        <h1>Create Custom Reports in Master Calendar
		</h1>
        <p>A Custom Reports function is available from the Admin menu. You use this function to create custom reports for retrieving information from your Master Calendar database. When you create a custom report, you can name and save the custom report so that you can run the custom report at any time that you choose. You can create a custom report from “scratch,” or you can create a custom report by copying an existing custom report and editing the copied custom report as needed. You can also edit a custom report, delete a custom report, print a custom report, and export custom report results to a PDF, XLS, or CSV file.
