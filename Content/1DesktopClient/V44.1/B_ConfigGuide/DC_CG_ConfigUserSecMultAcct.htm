        <h1 class="Heading1">Configure User Security for Multiple User Accounts</h1>
        <p>If you configure users individually (that is, you are not using user templates) and you need to mass assign security to multiple users (for example, you have added a new room and many of your users need access to the room), then you can&#160;use&#160;the User Security function. You can use the User Security function to mass assign security for categories, processes, rooms, and statues for multiple users that have been individually configured.</p>
