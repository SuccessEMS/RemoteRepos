        <h1>Searching by Keyword</h1>
        <p>You can keyword-search any field with the Search icon.</p> <p><img src="../images/C_UserGuide/MC_SearchbyKeyword_SearchIconField.png" style="width: 226px;height: 40px;" /></p> <p>Whether you are searching for events and special dates, or you are searching for other&#160;information in other areas of Master Calendar, the page from which you are carrying the<br />search always has a field into which you can enter partial or complete search criteria. This&#160;search field is frequently named “Keyword,” but is also can be named something else such as&#160;Title or Description.</p> <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tip" style="border-collapse: collapse;"> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top"><img alt="" class="internal default" style="width: 26px;height: 29px;" width="26px" height="29px" /></td> <td valign="top"> <p><strong><span style="color: #669933;">Concept:&#160;</span></strong>A search&#160;from a Master Calendar page is not case-sensitive and the search&#160;is limited to the exact order of characters in the search string and typically, the string can&#160;appear anywhere in the search results. For example, if you enter “ball” as your search string,&#160;search results can include Football, Baseball, Ballgame, and so on. In addition, the search&#160;string can appear in any information that is associated with the item for which you are&#160;searching. For example, if you are searching for an event, the search results can appear in the&#160;event name, the event description, and so on.&#160;Some searches that are accessible only to a Master Calendar site administrator&#160;require that the search results begin with the search string.</p> <![CDATA[ ]]></td> <![CDATA[ ]]></tr> <![CDATA[ ]]></tbody></table> <p><br />&#160;</p> <p>&#160;</p><hr /><p><strong>Page tags: </strong><a mt-export-translate="no">article:topic</a></p></body>
