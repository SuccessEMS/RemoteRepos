                        <p>Note:&#160;If a positional option is selected, then the system does not recognize standard day of the week abbreviations. For example, if Positional, Monday First is selected and the import data file contains MWF as the indicator for days of the week for a class, then the system interprets this as a Monday/Tuesday/ Wednesday class because there are no spaces between the characters. A Monday/Wednesday/Friday class is correctly indicated, in Positional, Monday First format as M_W_F, where the underscores represent spaces.</p>
