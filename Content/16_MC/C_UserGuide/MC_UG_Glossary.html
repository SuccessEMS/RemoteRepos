            <p><strong>Event Description</strong>—A text description of the event. The event description appears on the calendar when a guest or user clicks on the event name for more information about the event. After you enter a description, you can select the text and then use the standard Window formatting icons (color, text size, text weight, and so on) that are above the Event Description field to customize the formatting of the text.</p>
            <p><strong>Add Image</strong>—Click Browse to open the Choose File dialog box for browsing to and selecting an image that is to be associated with the event.</p>

            <p>• A Template dropdown list opens. You use this list to select the correct template for the user’s permissions.</p>
            <p>• Optionally, if you want to add permissions for the user in addition to the ones that are defined by the selected template, select Add additional permissions to template user to make the Permissions tab available again.</p>
            <p><strong>Administrator</strong>—This type of user has full access to all calendars in Master Calendar as well as to all system areas and functions.</p>
