        <h1 class="mt-export-title">What is an Override Room?</h1>
        <p>An&#160;<strong>Override&#160;Room</strong>&#160;is used in&#160;EMS&#160;to loosely define useable space which is not formally configured. For example, a building may have private&#160;offices which are not configured as spaces available for public use, but you may need to select such a space for an attendee who is participating remotely in a video conference. In order to provide company employees the ability to schedule meetings in these&#160;private&#160;rooms, Override Rooms can be configured in&#160;EMS.</p>

    <dt>Configuring an Override&#160;Room</dt>
    <dd>
    <p>1. Name the space in a way that indicates an Override&#160;Room&#160;(for example, "Override&#160;Area1”)<br />
    2. Classify the&#160;room&#160;as "Override Description”</p>

    <p>In the example above, "Override&#160;Area&#160;1” can be used repeatedly to serve as a placeholder for any meeting request which will occur in an un-configured space.</p>

    <p>For example on Monday a user makes a&#160;reservation&#160;for "Override&#160;Area&#160;1” and names it "Meeting in Mike Thompson’s Office”, and on Wednesday another user makes a&#160;reservation&#160;for "Override&#160;Area&#160;1” and names it "Meet Guests in&#160;Lobby Reception&#160;Area&#160;Prior to Building Tour”</p>

    <p>EMS&#160;does not track availability for events booked in Override Rooms; however,&#160;EMS&#160;reports on events that are scheduled in an override&#160;room&#160;as it would for an&#160;event scheduled for any other&#160;room.</p>
