        <p>Concept:&#160;Changing Events&#160;Can Automatically&#160;Notify Users&#160;</p>
        <p>Your Administrator can automate alerts&#160;to be sent to you (or groups of which you are a member) when changes or additions have been made in EMS for bookings and reservations,&#160;service orders, room types,&#160;setup types,&#160;user accounts, and so on. When you create a reservation or booking that has these&#160;notifications turned on, users will receive these alerts without requiring additional effort from you. Be sure to review these notification settings during the process of creating or modifying events.&#160;</p>
        <p>If your EMS Web App implementation uses the&#160;<a href="https://success.emssoftware.com/EMS_V44.1/001_Getting_Started_with_EMS_Desktop_Client/Using_the_Dashboard/020_Notifications_Tab#s3321" title="Integration to Microsoft Exchange Enables You to Use Outlook"><span class="Hyperlink">Integration with Exchange</span></a>, you can handle notifications using Outlook.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Notifications Tab Overview&#160;</h2>
        <p>When the Notifications tab&#160;first&#160;opens, all the notification rules that include you are listed in the Notification Rule pane (upper left pane) of the tab. Next to each rule, the number of&#160;newnotifications (notifications with the current day’s date) is displayed.</p>
