        <h1>Configure Everyday User Process Templates</h1>
        <p>Note:&#160;"Web Process Templates" Are Now Called "Everyday User Process Templates"</p>
        <p>If you have previously used older versions of EMS, you may know booking templates as "Web Process Templates." These are now called "Everyday User Process Templates." These templates define user access and booking behavior in EMS Web App, EMS Mobile App, and EMS for Outlook. Similarly, you may know permissions templates, which control what an Everyday User is able to do, as "Web Security Templates." These are now called "Everyday User Security Templates."</p>
        <ol>
            <li>On the EMS menu bar, click Configuration &gt; Everyday Applications &gt; Everyday User Process Templates. The Everyday User Process Templates window opens on the Everyday User Template tab.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        </p>
        <p>This window lists the process templates that have been defined for your EMS Web App implementation. The pre-defined user called "(unauthenticated user)" is included in all EMS implementations; you use this template to manage settings for anonymous or “guest” users. For a user to be able to view and use this template, you must assign the user to the template. See Configuring Users.</p>
        <p>Tip: To view all everyday user process templates in your EMS database, regardless of status, under Show, click Inactive.</p>
