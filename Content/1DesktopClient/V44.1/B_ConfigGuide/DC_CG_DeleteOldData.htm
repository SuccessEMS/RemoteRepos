        <h1 class="Heading1">Delete Old Data</h1>
        <p>As the EMS administrator, you can&#160;delete&#160;bookings, historical data, email history, holidays, building hours, notifications, and if applicable, EMS Kiosk transactions that occur on or before a specific date. You can also&#160;delete&#160;unused groups, contacts and web users (groups, contacts, and web users who have no associated records in your EMS database). If you delete all the bookings for a reservation, the reservation is also deleted from the EMS database. As a safeguard, it is a system requirement that the date that you specify for bookings, historical data, email history, holidays, building hours, or notifications be at least three months prior to the current day’s date.</p>
        <p>Before using the Delete Old Data utility, make a backup of your EMS database. Deletion of data using this utility is a permanent deletion and you can recover the data only by using a backup copy of your EMS database.</p>

        <ol start="2">
            <li>Select that data that is being deleted, and then, if applicable enter the on/or before deletion date.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Tip:&#160;The date that you specify for bookings, historical data, email history, holidays, building hours, notifications, and /or kiosk transactions must be at least three months prior to the current day’s date.</p>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>Click <span class="button">OK</span>. A message appears indicating that deleting this data is a permanent action and asking you if it is OK to continue.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Tip:&#160;Remember, if you delete all the bookings for a reservation, the reservation is also deleted from the EMS database; however, no message opens indicating that the reservation was also deleted.</p>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>Click <span class="button">Yes</span>. A message opens when all the data is deleted.</li>
