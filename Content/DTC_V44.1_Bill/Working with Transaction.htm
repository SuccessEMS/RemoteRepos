                    <th>
                        <p>Adjustment: A price adjustment for the event, such as a discount or late charge.</p>
                        <p>Damage Deposit: A refundable amount to cover possible damages during the event.</p>
                        <p>Deposit (Reservation)&#160;is best suited for reservations with one or more bookings that are to be invoiced in their entirety upon completion of the event.</p>
                        <p>Deposit (Bookings)&#160;is best suited for reservations with multiple bookings, for example, an event with multiple occurrences spanning several months, that is to be billed monthly. A Deposit (Bookings) allows you to spread the deposit across multiple months so that only a portion of the deposit is consumed and applied to the invoice that is generated monthly. In this scenario, a large deposit that is entered as Deposit (Reservation) would be consumed in its entirety by the first invoice that is generated.</p>
                        <p>Payment or Pre-payment:&#160;Remember that pre-payments act just like deposits in that they are applied to a reservation and are applied to an invoice reducing the balance due. Payments are applied to an invoice.</p>
                        <p>Refund: Funds reimbursed to the payee.</p>
