        <h1>Installation Overview</h1>
        <p>If you are unsure whether your organization is licensed for EMS Human Resources Toolkit or if you would like to learn more about it, please contact your Account Executive.</p>
        <p>Process Overview:</p>
        <p>To integrate the EMS Human Resources Toolkit, you will:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li>Identify the data source(s) in your organization to use as the source for your user records.</li>
            <li>Determine if user records are organized by groups and contacts (Group/Contact Model), by groups and group types (Group/Group Type Model), or all of these (Hybrid).</li>
            <li>Obtain and execute the .sql files for creating the staging database and stored procedures needed to import data into your EMS database.</li>
            <li>Establish a process for importing records into the staging database.</li>
            <li>Execute the EMS HR Toolkit stored procedure (using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to create an SQL job to run the stored procedure on a schedule).</li>
            <li>Maintain the source data to ensure continual data flow between your source(s) and EMS.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>&#160;Your Implementation Consultant will work with you to determine which variant will be best for your organization.&#160;The “Group/Contact” model is structured around having your Groups populated with Contacts beneath them; the “Group/Group Type” model categorizes User records by group and group type, and&#160;does not create Contacts under the Groups imported into the HRTK. The Hybrid Model will adjust the functionality based upon the&#160;GroupID&#160;criteria in the EMS_Staging.dbo.tblPeople table.&#160;Note that your EMS environment may use different names for Groups and Contacts, such as&#160;Employee.</p>
        <p>The EMS Human Resources Toolkit&#160;Installation Guide leads you through installing HR Toolkit in your environment.&#160;</p>

        <h2>Considerations for the HR Toolkit&#160;Hybrid Data Model&#160;</h2>
        <p>In some instances, it may be necessary to combine elements of the Group/Group Type and Group/Contact model HR Toolkits&#160;into a Hybrid data model. This is typically necessary when you will have some Everyday Application&#160;Users belonging to a department while other Everyday Application&#160;Users are not part of a department and are simply using EMS Web App&#160;on their own. For example,&#160;for study rooms on college campuses, students on campus could have access to EMS Web App&#160;to book these study spaces, but they may not all belong to a Group (department), and therefore are created following the Group/Group Type rules. Additionally, it is possible to have users that belong to both individual Groups and organizational Groups.&#160;For instance, John Doe could be created as a contact for the History department as well as an individual Group.&#160;You should work with your Professional Services Consultant for guidance on whether the Hybrid data model&#160;is right for you. &#160;</p>
