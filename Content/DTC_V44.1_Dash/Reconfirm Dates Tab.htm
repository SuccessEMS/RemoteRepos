        <h1 class="Heading1">Reconfirm Dates Tab</h1>
        <p>The Reconfirm Dates tab displays reservations that have been booked in a status that requires the Reconfirm Date option (for example, a Tentative or Hold status). The list of reservations is automatically sorted in ascending order by Reconfirm Date. You use this tab as a reminder to reconfirm such reservations.</p>

        <p>The tab is interactive. You can:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li>Select options to filter the reservations that are displayed on the tab. After you select or edit the filtering options, click Refresh.</li>
            <li>Status and Building/Area/View options are displayed on the left pane of the tab. You can select one or more statuses, or you can select all statuses in a single step. You can select a specific building, area, and/or view, or you can select all buildings, areas, and views in a single step.</li>
            <li>Date options are displayed on the View list at the top of the right pane of the tab. You can view reservations for the indicated due date. The default value is Thru Today. If a value from the pre-configured list does not meet your needs, then select (user specified) and in the Date Due fields, enter at least a Starting due date. The Ending due date is optional.</li>
            <li>Select the reservation in the Reservations list, and then click Go To to open the reservation in the Navigator.</li>
