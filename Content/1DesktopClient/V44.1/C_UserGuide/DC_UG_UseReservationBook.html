        <h1 class="mt-export-title">Using the Reservation Book</h1>
        <p>The Reservation Book provides a view of all the confirmed reservations (the reserved time as well as the room for which the reservation is scheduled) for your organization. (Canceled bookings are not shown.) You use the Reservation Book to view information for a reservation, to edit an existing reservation, and to make a new reservation. In addition, before you edit or make a reservation, you can change the Reservation Book display so it better suits your working needs.</p>
        <p>Concept:&#160;Space is Hierarchical in EMS (click to expand)&#160;</p>
        <p>In EMS, your organization's office is made up of locations, spaces, and users.&#160;</p>
        <h4>Locations</h4>
        <p>A physical area representing multiple spaces. Depending on how large your company is, it could be anything from "West Coast HQ" to a campus-level "Mail Room 6". &#160;and can contain&#160;multiple rooms, buildings, and other spaces.</p>
        <h4>Areas</h4>
        <p>Similar to locations, and area can also include multiple locations, and helps you group locations, buildings, and rooms by your own organization's&#160;</p>
        <h4>Buildings</h4>
        <p>A physical building containing rooms, with pre-defined equipment and service options. Buildings belong to Locations.&#160;</p>
        <h4>Rooms</h4>
        <p>Rooms with pre-defined equipment and service options. Rooms&#160;belong to a Building. You can think of the hierarchy like this: Your Company&#160;&gt; New York HQ &gt; Client Consultation Area &gt; Central Park Building &gt; Nicest Conference Room</p>
        <h4>Users</h4>
        <p>When you add users in EMS, how you define their user profiles and booking templates control whether they will&#160;be able to schedule&#160;events in the rooms you've configured.&#160;</p>
        <p>To open the Reservation Book, on the EMS toolbar, click the Book icon&#160;<img src="../../../Resources/Images/DTC_V44H_ResBooks/Using the Reservation Book.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 46px;height: 52px;" alt="emsum_Reservations_image015.png" />; a window opens where you can see all confirmed reservations for today. You can set Filters along the top, such as&#160;Building,&#160;View, and&#160;Date&#160;to change the events listed, and you can change the time zone displayed. All today's reservations that meet the filtering criteria are displayed in the book in the&#160;Daily&#160;view. You may have to scroll up and down to see&#160;all reservations.&#160;</p>

If you are setting your Reservation Book options, and you do not want to the Room Filter dialog box to open on top of the Reservation Book when you open the book, then do the following:</p>
                    <p>• Clear Always Prompt for Room Filter on Startup.</p>
                    <p>• Clear Show (‘all’) in Building List.</p>
                    <p>• On the Building dropdown list in the Reservation Book, select any building, area, or view.</p>
                    <p>Note:&#160;The building, area, or view that you select is not important. This last step just clears the “all” building option from the Reservation Book cache and ensures that the Room Filter dialog box does not open on top of the Reservation Book. Going forward, you can always select all buildings, or any specific building, area, or view as needed when you are working in the Reservation Book.</p>
