        <h1>Categories, Resources, and Services:&#160;What's the Difference?</h1>
        <p>In EMS, you may hear these terms used interchangeably sometimes, however, they are different concepts.</p>
        <p>A <span class="button">Category </span>in EMS is anything you might add to a Booking such as Catering, Audio Visual, Furniture, Security, Notes, Attendee Names, Agendas etc. When you configure a Category, however, it must be of six Category types: Activities, Attendees, Catering, Notes, Resources with Service Orders, or Resources Without Service Orders. These types cause the service to behave slightly differently when added to a booking. For example, a Notes/Activities/Attendees type service category does not require the EMS Administrator to configure items under it and there is nothing for a person to “select” from these types of services.</p>
        <p>By contrast, a <span class="button">Service </span>category that has a type of Catering, Resource with Service Order, or a Resource without a Service Order Category, will require the Administrator to create items under it. For example, an "AV Equipment" service  category (configured as a Resource without a Service Order Category type) might have items under it such as a flip chart, whiteboard, (under AV Equipment). The person requesting the service for this meeting would then select AV equipment; then flipchart and whiteboard would be typical options to add to the event.</p>
        <p>Tip: The following Category Types allow Production Items: Catering, Resources with Service Orders, and Resources Without Service Orders.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, a Category can be configured to "Use States" so that when a service is requested with a meeting, it can be managed through a review and approval process in the Manage Services toolbar option in  <MadCap:variable name="General.EMS&#160;Desktop Client" />.</p>
