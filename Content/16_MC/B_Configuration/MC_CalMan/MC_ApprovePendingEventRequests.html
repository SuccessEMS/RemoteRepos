            <li>Select the pending events that you are approving.&#160;To select all pending events on the currently opened page for approval in a single&#160;step, select the column heading,&#160;<strong>Title</strong>. If you have multiple pages of events to approve, you must repeat&#160;this entire process on each page.</li>
            <li>Under Actions, click <strong>Approve</strong>.&#160;A message opens asking you if you are sure that you want to approve all selected events.</li>
            <li>Click <strong>OK </strong>in the message.&#160;A message opens indicating that all selected events were approved.</li>
            <li>Click <strong>OK </strong>in the message.&#160;The events are approved and are removed from the Pending Events list. For each&#160;approved event, an email is automatically generated and sent to the event requestor&#160;informing them that the Calendar Manager has approved their request.</li>

        <p>Tip:&#160;To have Master Calendar automatically generate and send emails indicating the&#160;event status (approved or rejected), your site administrator must have set the&#160;default System Configuration settings for email—name of sender, SMTP server,&#160;and address of sender. If your system is not automatically sending and generating&#160;emails after you approve or reject an event request, work with your site&#160;administrator to ensure that the necessary default settings have been specified.</p>
