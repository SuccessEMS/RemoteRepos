        <h1>Maintain Departments in Master Calendar</h1>
        <p>A <em>depar</em><em>tment</em>&#160;in Master Calendar&#160;is a division of a business specializing in a particular product or service, such as a Personnel department,&#160;or a division of a school or college such as the Department of Chemistry. You can configure departments for Master Calendar so that additional information/clarification can be provided for an event. For example, if you are managing calendars for a university campus and you specify a multi-use building as an event location, you could also specify the department that is hosting/sponsoring the event. This topic guides you in&#160;adding departments, activating departments, inactivating departments, editing departments, and deleting departments.</p>
