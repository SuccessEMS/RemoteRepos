        <p>The academic scheduling process is a multi-step process for enabling online communication between the Domain Scheduler and academic units, optimizing academic space use, and creating reservations in EMS Academic Planning for academic courses. To use the full functionality of EMS Academic Planning, it is important that you understand the&#160;<a href="https://success.emssoftware.com/001_Using_EMS__(V44.1)/Using_EMS_for_Microsoft®_Outlook/Using_EMS/EMS_Desktop_Client/130_Academic_Planning_EMS_Campus/010-Overview_of_the_Academic_Scheduling_Process#RTF41636164656d69635465726d"><span class="Hyperlink_2">academic&#160;</span></a><span class="link">scheduling specific terms</span>&#160;that are used in EMS Academic Planning and that you have a high-level understanding of the&#160;<a href="https://success.emssoftware.com/001_Using_EMS__(V44.1)/Using_EMS_for_Microsoft®_Outlook/Using_EMS/EMS_Desktop_Client/130_Academic_Planning_EMS_Campus/010-Overview_of_the_Academic_Scheduling_Process#RTF4153435f70726f63657373"><span class="Hyperlink_2">a</span></a><span class="link">cademic scheduling configuration process</span>.</p>
