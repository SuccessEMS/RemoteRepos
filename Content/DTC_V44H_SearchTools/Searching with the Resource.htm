        <h1>Search with the Resource Calendar</h1>
        <p>You use the Resource Calendar to&#160;search&#160;for a particular resource and determine how much of the resource (that is, how many individual items) is needed for a specific day or month in a specific year. For example, how many slices of key lime pie are needed in November, 2017? You can use the results of the search to assist you in managing the counts of the resources that your organization must ensure are available for scheduled events. When you carry out a search in the Resource Calendar, you can carry out a&#160;basic search&#160;or an&#160;advanced search. A&#160;basic search&#160;is based on the basic information that you specify for a resource item when you first create it, such as its category and status. An&#160;advanced search&#160;is a field level search that is carried out the booking level, the booking detail level, the booking detail item level, the reservation level, the service order level, or any combination of these. For example, in an advanced search, you can specify criteria as granular the date that the service order reminder was added. You can open a resource item that has been returned in the search results in the Navigator, and edit the item if needed.</p>
