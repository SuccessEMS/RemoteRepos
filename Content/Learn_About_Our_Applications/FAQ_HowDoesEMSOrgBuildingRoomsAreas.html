        <header>
<p>In EMS, your organization's office is made up of locations, spaces, and users.&#160;</p>

<h4>Locations</h4>
</header>

<p>A physical area representing multiple spaces. Depending on how large your company is, it could be anything from "West Coast HQ" to a campus-level "Mail Room 6". &#160;and can contain&#160;multiple rooms, buildings, and other spaces.</p>

<h4>Areas</h4>

<p>Similar to locations, and area can also include multiple locations, and helps you group locations, buildings, and rooms by your own organization's&#160;</p>

<h4>Buildings</h4>

<p>A physical building containing rooms, with pre-defined equipment and service options. Buildings belong to Locations.&#160;</p>

<h4 id="spaces">Rooms</h4>

<p>Rooms with pre-defined equipment and service options. Rooms&#160;belong to a Building. You can think of the hierarchy like this: Your Company&#160;&gt; New York HQ &gt; Client Consultation Area &gt; Central Park Building &gt; Nicest Conference Room</p>

<h4>Users</h4>

<p>When you add users in EMS, how you define their user profiles and booking templates control whether they will&#160;be able to schedule&#160;events in the rooms you've configured.&#160;</p>
