            <p>Organizations with a mobile workforce or flexible work arrangements often adopt a "workspace (hoteling or hot-desking) strategy—allotting workspace on an as-needed basis to accommodate more people in less space. EMS is a facility scheduling system for managing workspace requirements, as well as the booking of meeting/event space and resources.</p>
            <p>Note: Older versions of EMS had "building-level check-in;" this has been replaced with booking-level check-in.</p>
