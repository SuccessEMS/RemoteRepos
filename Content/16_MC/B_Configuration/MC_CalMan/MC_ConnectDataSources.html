        <h1>Connect to Data Sources</h1>
        <p>Data Sources consist of Event Types, Holidays, and User-Defined fields defined in your EMS implementation.</p>
        <p><strong>Process Overview:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>To connect to data sources, you will</p>
        <ul class="mt-indent-1">
            <li>Establish data connections from EMS to Master Calendar.</li>
            <li><a title="Connecting Master Calendar to Your EMS Database">Set up connectors</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In Master Calendar, as the site administrator, you have the option of setting up event types and holidays (special dates) from “scratch;” however, if you are an existing EMS customer who uses one of the EMS products, such as Campus, Desktop Client, Enterprise, Professional, Legal, and so on, this means that you have already configured this information for your EMS application. Rather than creating these items from scratch, if your organization has purchased the optional module, Master Calendar Data Connectors, you can follow the steps in this topic&#160;to perform a one-time import of event types and holidays from your EMS application into Master Calendar. You can import event types and holidays from one or more EMS databases to one or more calendars in Master Calendar. Also, at the data source level, you can select a high-level view of your user-defined fields (UDFs) in your EMS database, and you can then run a connector to import one or more selected UDFs and their associated answers into your Master Calendar database. Managing data sources in Master Calendar consists of adding data sources, deleting data sources, importing the event types, importing the holidays, and selecting the UDFs that are to be imported. You can also view the history of event type mapping between your EMS database and your Master Calendar database.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Description—The name of the database into which you are importing the event types and/or holidays.</li>
            <li>Database Server Name—The name for the database server on which the EMS database from which you are importing the information resides.</li>
            <li>Database Name—The name of the EMS database from which you are importing the event types and/or holidays.</li>

        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li> If appropriate, select the option <strong>EMS database resides on the same server or you are using a linked server</strong>.&#160;You can obtain the database server name and the database name by logging in to the EMS client and then choosing <strong>Select File</strong> &gt; <strong>Change Database</strong>, or you can work with your local Database Administrator to obtain the correct server name and database name.</li>
            <li>Click <strong>Test Data Source</strong>.&#160;If Master Calendar can connect to the specified EMS database, a message opens indicating that the “Connection succeeded.” Otherwise, the message indicates that the “Connection failed,” and provides a reason for the failure. You must make the necessary changes to the data connector, and test the connection again.</li>
            <li>After the message indicates that the “Connection succeeded,” click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>

        <p>When you are importing event types from EMS into Master Calendar, you have three options. You can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Map an EMS event type to an existing Master Calendar event type.</li>
            <li>Create an EMS event type in Master Calendar if it doesn’t already exist.</li>
            <li>Indicate that you do not want to import the EMS event type.</li>

It also shows the mapping for each event type, or whether it has been set to “Do Not Use.” If an EMS event type has <em>not</em> been mapped to a Master Calendar event type, and it has <em>not</em> been set to “Do Not Use,” then the “Create” option is displayed for it in the Master Calendar Event Type list.</li>
