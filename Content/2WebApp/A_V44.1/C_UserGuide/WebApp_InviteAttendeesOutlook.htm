        <h1>Inviting Attendees with Outlook</h1>
        <p>If your organization has deployed EMS for Microsoft Outlook,&#160;you can check attendees' availability as shown in Outlook. EMS automatically sends meeting i<a href="https://success.emssoftware.com/001_Using_EMS__(V44.1)/Using_EMS_Web_App_V44.1/030MakingReservations/Sending_Notifications" title="https://success.emssoftware.com/EMS_V44.1/Using_EMS/Using_the_EMS_Web_App/030MakingReservations/Sending_Notifications">nvitations</a>&#160;to attendees when you make a&#160;reservation in EMS Web App.</p>
        <p>Note: Because EMS Web App is highly configurable, options that we show in the following procedure may not be present in your organization's implementation of EMS. Also, your organization may have customized some labels; for example, “group” may be “client,” “employee,” or “department”; "event" may be “Meeting,” and so on. Required fields are marked with a red asterisk (*).</p>

            <li>Begin&#160;<a href="https://success.emssoftware.com/001_Using_EMS__(V44.1)/Using_EMS_Web_App_V44.1/030MakingReservations" title="Making Reservations">creating a reservation</a>.</li>
            <li>When you select attendees,&#160;the Create a Reservation window will show their availability in&#160;a calendar grid.</li>

        <p>Concept: Depending on how your Administrator has configured EMS Web App templates, you might see different fields displayed, or you might not see some of these fields displayed at all.</p>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>Once you have completed the reservation and clicked&#160;Create Reservation, attendees will receive invitations based on the booking template you used. Changes you may make to the event will also trigger email updates.</li>
        </ol>
