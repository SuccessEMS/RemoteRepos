        <h2 class="Heading2">Resolving Booking Conflicts When You Receive a Warning Email&#160;</h2>
        <p>As the meeting scheduler, you may receive a booking error message (such as "One or more of your rooms were not available and are in conflict. Refer to your email for next steps.") and an email that indicates the bookings that are in conflict&#160;for the reservation.</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_1">
            <li class="ListParagraph"><span class="span_3">Locate the email&#160;with the warning email</span>&#160;which begins, "The following rooms could not be reserved because they are unavailable. You must reserve a new room for each time slot shown below." (or similar)</li>

        <p>You may receive a popup message when booking a meeting saying "One of the rooms you selected is&#160;not available and are in conflict" (or similar). This means that you requested space that is already booked. The room will show in your bookings list as "Conflict - [room name]".&#160;The EMS for Outlook add-in opens the&#160;<span class="span_1">Resolve Conflicts&#160;</span>popup, where you can select a different room for the unresolved days.</p>
