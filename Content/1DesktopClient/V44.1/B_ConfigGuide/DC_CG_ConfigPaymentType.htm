        <h1 class="Heading1">Configure Payment Types</h1>
        <p>A&#160;<span class="button">payment type</span>&#160;indicates the forms of payment that your organization accepts. Payment types are also used to track the forms of payment that your groups are using. Examples of payment types include checks, credit card, and cash. Because payment types are for informational purposes only and do not affect the pricing or billing of an event, configuration of payment types is not required; however, after you&#160;configure&#160;payment types, you can assign a default payment type to a group’s record. Whenever a user makes a reservation for the group, the default payment type is displayed automatically in the Payment Type field on the Billing tab of the Reservation Wizard.</p>
        <ol start="1">

This window lists all the payment types that are currently configured in your EMS database and that have a status of Active.</li>

        <ol start="4">
            <li>Leave Inactive blank to add the payment type as an active payment type. Optionally, select Inactive to inactivate the payment type.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="button">OK</span>.&#160;The Payment Type dialog box closes. You return to the Payment Types window with the newly configured payment type automatically selected.</li>
