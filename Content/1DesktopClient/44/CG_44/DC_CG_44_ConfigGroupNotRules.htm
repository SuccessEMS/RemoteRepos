        <h1 class="Heading1">Configure Group Notification Rules</h1>
        <p><span class="button">Group notification rules</span> determine the conditions under which groups that are holding events at your facility are reminded through an email notification about their events. You&#160;configure&#160;group notifications based on rooms, statuses, event types, group types, and/or categories. A group notification is generated only if all the criteria that you specified is met. For example, if you specify Room 100, Confirmed status&#160;with&#160;catering, then a Confirmed meeting in Room 100&#160;without&#160;a catering service order does&#160;not&#160;result in a notification being generated. Group notification emails contain a summary of the group's events. For example, if a group has a weekly Friday meeting (a booking) that continues for several months, and you define a group notification rule with a monthly frequency, then the group receives a notification email once a month that lists all the Friday meetings for the month.</p>
        <p>Note:&#160;Configuring Group Notification Rules is similar to configuring notification rules for individuals. If you are familiar with this process, you can apply the same rules for groups.</p>
        <p>You can configure multiple group notifications in EMS Enterprise. You can configure only a single group notification in EMS Professional. For notification emails to be sent, the EMS Email Notification Service must be installed and configured. Refer to the EMS Installation instructions for details.</p>
        <p>This section contains information on the following:</p>
