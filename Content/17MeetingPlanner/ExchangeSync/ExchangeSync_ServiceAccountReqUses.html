        <h1>Service Account Requirements &amp; Use</h1> <h2>Required Permissions</h2> <h3>Exchange</h3> <p>The account will require a mailbox on the Exchange server and permissions for the resources and user accounts that the Exchange Sync service will be acting upon. &#160;There are two different privileges that can be granted to the service account for each mailbox that needs to be managed by Exchange Sync:</p> <p><strong>Calendar Permission: &#160;</strong>Granting "Editor" level delegate permissions will be sufficient to&#160;allowing the Exchange Sync service to create and modify meetings only; the service will not be able to delete meetings from the calendar. &#160;In a standard Exchange 2010 environment, this would be accomplished by running the following command in the Exchange Management Shell:</p> <blockquote> <p>Add-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity UserOrRoom:\Calendar -User ServiceAcct&#160;-AccessRights ReadItems,EditAllItems,DeleteAllItems</p></blockquote> <p><strong>Deleted Items Permission: &#160;</strong>Granting "Contributor" permissions to the 'Deleted Items' folder&#160;will allow the Exchange Sync service to create, modify, and delete meetings; without these permissions, the service will only be able to create and modify meetings on the calendar. &#160;In a standard Exchange 2010 environment, this would be accomplished by running the following command in the Exchange Management Shell:</p> <blockquote> <p>Add-MailboxFolderPermission -Identity UserOrRoom:"\Deleted Items" -User ServiceAcct&#160;-AccessRights CreateItems</p></blockquote> <p><em>Note: "Moves" and "deletes" do not automatically send out notifications to invited users; these will need to be done manually by the user.</em></p> <h3>Application Server</h3> <p>The account will also require Local Administrator access on the application server, and "Log on as a batch job" permissions.</p> <p><strong>Local Administrator (Start &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Computer Management)</strong></p> <p><strong><img alt="Image_002.png" src="http://support.emergingsoft.com/attachments/token/ieflpvyx5go6xqz/?name=Image+002.png" /></strong></p> <p><strong>Log on as a batch job (Start &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Local Security Settings)</strong></p> <p><strong><img alt="Image_001.png" src="http://support.emergingsoft.com/attachments/token/ipkyicbo21hglhh/?name=Image+001.png" style="width: 800px;" /></strong></p> <h2><strong>Additional Requirements</strong></h2> <p>The account will need to access the Exchange server from the application server, so there cannot be a Group Policy, Firewall, or Proxy that will prevent this from happening.</p> <h3>Account Uses</h3> <ul> <li>MeetingPlanner Exchange Sync service Log On account (Start &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Services).</li> <li>Will be entered in the MeetingPlanner Configuration Tool on the application server ("Exchange Sync" tab).</li> <li>Will be entered into the MeetingPlanner Web &gt; Setup &gt; General Settings &gt; Room page as well. &#160;This will be the account used to create tasks, which will be used to send meeting conflict notifications.</li></ul> <h3>Security</h3> <p>Once entered into MeetingPlanner, the service account name and password will be encrypted and stored in two configuration files located on the MeetingPlanner application server.</p><hr /><p><strong>Page tags: </strong><a mt-export-translate="no">article:topic</a><a mt-export-translate="no">persona:UserFacilitiesMgr</a></p></body>
