        <h1>Editing an Event</h1>
        <p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">From the </span><a title="Managing an Event from the Event Summary Page">Event Summary page</a><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">, you can use the <strong>Edit Event</strong> option&#160;or&#160;the <strong>Edit </strong>option. The information you can edit is different for these two options. Also, you must consider whether you are editing a single date event, or a multi-date event.</span>
        </p> <p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><strong>When editing a single date event</strong>:</span></p> <ul> <li><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Select the <strong>Edit Event</strong> option to&#160;edit the general information for the event,&#160;add an image to the event, edit additional information for the event, and edit attachments.</span></li> <li><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Select the <strong>event date</strong> on any of the three tabs (<strong>All, Current, </strong>or <strong>Historical</strong>) and then click <strong>Edit</strong>, to edit general information for the event, including canceling the event, add an image to the event, change event times, and&#160;edit the custom fields.</span></li></ul> <p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;"><strong>When editing a multi-date event</strong>, you can edit either the “top-level” event information (the main event), or you can edit individual dates for the event (the event occurrences).</span></p> <ul> <li><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">When you edit the main event option, the same edits are applied to all the event occurrences. </span></li> <li><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">When you edit an event occurrence, the edits are applicable only for the selected occurrence.</span></li></ul> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">No other event occurrences are affected. Further, any edits that you make to an event occurrence override the edits that you make to the main event. For example, if you attach an image at the main event level, then this image is displayed for all event occurrences; however, you can also attach a unique image for each occurrence of a multi-date event. If you attach a unique image at the event occurrence level, this image overrides any image that is attached at the main event level.</span></p> <p><strong><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">When&#160;editing a multi-date event:</span></strong></p> <p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">• At the main event level, you must select the <strong>Edit Event</strong> option. You can change&#160;general information for the main event, add an image to the main event, edit additional information for the main event, and edit attachments for the main event.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">• At the&#160;event occurrence level, you must select the <strong>event date</strong> on any of the three tabs (<strong>All</strong>, <strong>Current</strong>, or <strong>Historical</strong>), and then click <strong>Edit </strong>to&#160;edit general information for the event occurrence, including canceling the occurrence. You can also add an image to the event occurrence, edit event times for the occurrence, and edit custom fields for the event occurrence.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">If an event that you are editing was imported into Master Calendar from EMS, any information that was originally entered for the event in EMS is not available for editing. Only the information that was entered for the event in Master Calendar (event description, custom fields, and so on) is available for editing. If you need to edit information for the event that was originally entered in EMS, you must edit this information in EMS, and then re-import the event into Master Calendar from EMS.</span></p><hr class="mt-export-separator" /><p class="template:tag-insert"><strong>Page tags: </strong><a mt-export-translate="no">article:topic</a></p></body>
