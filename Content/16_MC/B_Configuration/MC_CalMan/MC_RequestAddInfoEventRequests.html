        <h1>Request Additional Information for Event Requests</h1>
        <p>You use the Request Event Info option on the <a title="Managing Events from the Manage Events Page">Manage Events</a> page to request information&#160;from the EMS Contact for a selected event that has been pulled into Master Calendar from an&#160;EMS database.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the&#160;Manage Events page, <a title="Filtering Events on the Manage Events Page">filter&#160;</a>for the pending events that you are approving.&#160;</li>
            <li>Click the EMS tab.&#160;This tab shows all the events that have been pulled from an EMS database into Master<br />Calendar via a connector.</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Select the event or events for which you need more information from the EMS Contact,&#160;and then under Actions, click Request Event Info.&#160;The Request Event Info dialog box opens.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><em>Request Event Info dialog box</em>

        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Enter any questions that you would like to request of the EMS Contact, and then click&#160;Send.</li>
            <li>Click OK in the prompt about sending an email to request more information.</li>
            <li>Click OK in the confirmation message.&#160;The email is sent to the EMS Contact for the selected event. The email contains a "Fill out&#160;more info" link that the EMS Contact can click to open an Additional Info page on which they can enter or edit the requested information and&#160;then submit the information. This action essentially allows the EMS contact to work&#160;directly with the event in Master Calendar and prevents you from having to manually&#160;enter the information that you have requested from the EMS contact.</li>
        </ol>

        </p>Tip: Depending on how your site administrator has configured Master Calendar, after the EMS Contact modifies the information for the&#160;event, the event request may be set to a Pending status. An automated email would then be&#160;generated and sent to the Calendar Manager informing the manager of the&#160;modifications by the contact and the status change to “Pending” for the event.<p>&#160;</p></body>
