        <h1 class="Heading1">Importing Resources for a Category</h1>
        <p>You can&#160;import&#160;resources for a category from a tab-delimited file. (See&#160;“Import File Specifications,”&#160;for the import file specifications.) After you import the resources, you can edit their configurations as necessary.</p>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>On the EMS menu bar, click <span class="button">Configuration </span>&gt; <span class="button">Resources</span>. A list of all the categories that are currently configured in your EMS database&#160;and&#160;for which you can configure resources opens.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol start="2">
            <li>Select the category for which you are importing the resources. The Resources window opens. This window lists all the resources that are currently configured in your EMS database for the selected category and that have a status of Active.</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>Optionally, do one or both of the following:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>To view all resources for the category in your EMS database, regardless of status, under Show, click Inactive.</li>
            <li>To filter the displayed resources based on the Resource name, in the Filter field, enter a search string.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tip:&#160;The search string is not case-sensitive, but your search is limited to the exact order of the characters in the string and it must begin with the information for which you are searching. For example, a search string of&#160;Cold&#160;returns&#160;Cold&#160;Boxed Lunches, but not Sandwiches (Cold).</p>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>Click Import. The Import Resources dialog box opens.</li>

        <ol start="5">
            <li>Click the <span class="button">Search </span>icon&#160;to open the Find Resource Import File dialog, and then browse to and select the resource file that is to be imported.</li>
            <li>On the Rate Schedule dropdown list, select the rate schedule that applies to the resource. (See&#160;“Rate schedules”.)</li>
            <li>Click <span class="button">Import</span>. A dialog box opens, indicating the number of resources that you are about to import, and asking you if you want to continue.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="button">Yes</span>. A message appears indicating that the import was successful.</li>
            <li>Click <span class="button">OK </span>to close the message and return to the Resources window.</li>
