        <h1>Upgrade Requirements Update 14</h1>
        <p>Before upgrading, please read the important upgrade considerations below.</p>
        <h2>EMS Desktop Client</h2>
        <p>Versions 11 and later of the Web Deploy Desktop Client will be required to upgrade to Update 14. This is due to a failure of the Web deploy to automatically update.</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>
                        <img src="../../Resources/Images/Release Notes Updates 14.3-11.1/V44 1 Update 14 1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 50px;height: 50px;" alt="https://success.emssoftware.com/@api/deki/files/3857/tech_doc_warning.png?revision=1&amp;size=bestfit&amp;width=26&amp;height=25" />
                    </p>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>Warning:&#160;Do not try to manually update the Web Deploy using the AutoUpdate.exe. You will receive an error, "EMS is having trouble connecting," and the Desktop Client will stop working completely.&#160;</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h2>EMS Room Sign App (formerly Glance)&#160;</h2>
        <p>As of Update 12, significant changes were made to&#160;the former EMS Glance product. The Update renames Glance to the EMS Room Sign App and also greatly updates the visual design.&#160;You may have to manually refresh the Room Sign App page on each tablet following your upgrade. To refresh the page on an iPad, you should close the browser and &#160;re-open it using the homelink. We are working to ensure you will not have to do so in the future.</p>
        <h2>EMS Mobile App&#160;</h2>
        <p>EMS Mobile App Update 12 is compatible with Platform Services Update 12, as well as previous versions.&#160;Platform Services Update 12 is NOT compatible with previous versions of EMS Mobile App. Customers upgrading to Platform Services Update 12 must upgrade to EMS Mobile App Update 12.</p>
