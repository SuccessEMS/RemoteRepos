This topic simply guides you in adding a service order to a booking.</li>
            <li>Focus the Navigator on the booking within that reservation for which you wish to add services, equipment, etc. and click the&#160;<strong>Tools </strong>button, then select <strong>Add Booking Details Wizard</strong> (your Administrator may have re-labeled this option; if it does appear, services are not allowed for this type of booking).&#160;<br />    &#160;</li>

                <p>When you have completed the fields in the right panel, click the&#160;<strong>Next </strong>button. {{product_dtc}} advances you through the information you must enter to complete the service order. Tabs and fields that display to you vary depending on how the type of service is configured for your organization. The example below shows a catering service order that is defined to allow you to add menu items; two have been added to the right panel which indicates menu items to be included with the order (in this case, for 5 servings). The same type of window displays for other types of services such as equipment; the only difference is that the items may be human activities such as setup, teardown, opening windows, turning on lights, and so on.<br /><br /><img alt="" class="internal default" /></p>
