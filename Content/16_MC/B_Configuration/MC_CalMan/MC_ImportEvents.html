        <h1>Import Events Into Your Master Calendar System</h1>
        <p>You use the Import Events function to import events into Master Calendar. The file that contains the events can be a tab-delimited file that has been created in another system such as Microsoft Excel or it can be an XML file. You can import a tab-delimited file or an XML file into Master Calendar only if it adheres to file specifications that DEA has defined for Master Calendar.</p>
        <p>To obtain file specifications and view examples of allowed files, click the <strong>Import file specification</strong>s link on the <strong>Details</strong> tab of the <strong>Imports</strong> page. To access this link, do one of the following:</p>
        <p>• Click Admin &gt; Event and Special Dates &gt; <strong>Import Events</strong>, and then click <strong>Add</strong>.</p>
        <p>• Select an imported event, and then click <strong>Edit</strong>.</p>
        <p>This topic guides you in&#160;<a>importing</a> an event, <a>editing, deleting</a>&#160;and purging imported events, and viewing&#160;the history for an imported event.</p>
        <p>Tip: Make sure Master Calendar is <a target="_blank" title="Connecting Master Calendar to Your EMS Database">connected to the EMS database as a data source</a> and has <a title="Connecting to Data Sources">connectors set up</a>.&#160;</p>
