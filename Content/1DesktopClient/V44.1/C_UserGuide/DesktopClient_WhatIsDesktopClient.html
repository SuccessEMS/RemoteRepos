    <p><em>Expert users</em> include conference center managers, event coordinators, registrars, facility and real estate managers, and service providers. They can use this tool to set up and control the booking process and booking templates, define space (buildings, rooms, floors, areas, and regions), define services,&#160;manage security and user permissions, grant access, initiate notifications and reports, and integrate with other applications, servers, databases, and systems. <em>Everyday users</em>, such as an employee who needs to book a conference room or a consultant who needs to book a hoteling space for the day,&#160;can use it to make reservations and book meetings.<br />

<h3>Who Uses EMS?</h3>

<p>There are two different user types for EMS software:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Administrators</strong>:&#160;These users create and maintain the EMS application within your organization, and manage or approve usage of space. This user type may&#160;also include Service Providers (Catering, Audio Visual, IT Support Staff), Security, and Receptionist Staff. These users will primarily use the {{product_dtc}}.</li>
    <li><strong>Everyday Users</strong>:&#160;This is the&#160;majority of the users in the organization. Everyday users are&#160;typically requesting rooms and services. These users do not use the {{product_dtc}}.&#160;They generally&#160;use web-based EMS applications such as&#160;{{product_webapp}} and&#160;{{product_mobile}}.&#160;</li>
</ol>
