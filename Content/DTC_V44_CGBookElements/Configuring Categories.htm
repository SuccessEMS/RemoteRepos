        <h1 class="Heading1">Configuring Categories</h1>
        <p>Categories&#160;(also called&#160;booking details) are the activities, attendees, notes, services, and room charges that you can add to a booking. For example, your organization can create a category called A/V Equipment that contains resources such as flip charts, projectors, and so on. Although you can use categories to track setup notes, meeting attendees, and activities for a booking, you do not configure resources for these categories. You need to configure categories only for services. Configuring a category is a two step process. First, you must create the category. Second, after you create the category, you must define its resources.</p>

                        <p>Select a category type that is appropriate for the new category. Typically, the determining factor is how the category is to be used.</p>
                        <p>• Activities—Agenda-type entries that describe what is to occur during an event, for example: 8:30 a.m. - 9:00 a.m., Registration; 9:00 a.m. - 10:00 a.m, Keynote Speaker, and so on.</p>
                        <p>• Attendees—Individuals who are attending an event. You can use this category for attendees such as VIPs or guest speakers, or to serve as an attendee checklist for smaller meetings.</p>
                        <p>• Notes—A free-form block of text that is used to enter clarifying or miscellaneous information about the event. For example, your users can use this booking detail to describe room setup for an event such as “Set room temp. at 70 degrees one hour prior to event” or “Please unlock doors at 7 a.m.”</p>
                        <p>• Resources, w/o Service Orders—Resources that are assigned to a booking from a Resources, w/o Service Orders category are assigned for the entire event time. Typically used to manage Audio/Visual Equipment and Furniture categories.</p>
                        <p>• Resources, w Service Orders—Similar to Resources, w/o Service Orders categories with one exception—you must indicate the specific time that the items that are assigned to a booking from this category are needed. The end result is one or multiple service orders with specific services times before, during or after the event.</p>
                        <p>• Catering—Used to manage catering categories. Provides capability similar to the Resources, w Service Order category in addition to the catering specific fields of Estimated Count, Guaranteed Count, and Actual Count.</p>
