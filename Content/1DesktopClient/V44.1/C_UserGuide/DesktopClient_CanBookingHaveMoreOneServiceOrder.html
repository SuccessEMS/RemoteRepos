        <p><span><span><span>A Service Order in EMS is a request to use a resource for a specified time period as opposed to using the resource for an entire event.&#160;</span></span></span>You can create multiple service orders in the same&#160;booking. For example, you might have a number of catering services (breakfast, lunch, and afternoon refreshments) in the course of a one day training&#160;event. In this case, in {{product_dtc}},&#160;multiple folders show under the&#160;booking&#160;folder on the left side of the Navigator window, with each folder representing a unique&#160;service order.</p>
