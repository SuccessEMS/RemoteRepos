        <h1 class="Heading1">Configuring Building Hours</h1>
        <p>By default, when you configure&#160;a building, the building hours are set to Open All Day, which means that the building is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. If needed, you can configure the hours for a building so that a building is open only for a specified time period on a particular date or for a given date range. You can also configure the hours so that a building is closed all day. You can configure&#160;the hours for a building for a single date, or you can configure&#160;the hours for multiple dates in a single step.</p>

                        <p>In the EMS client, configured building hours do not prevent a user from scheduling events outside these hours. A user is merely warned that the event is being scheduled outside normal operating hours. In VEMS, users cannot schedule events outside the configured building hours. Setup and teardown hours must also fall within the configured building hours for an event that is scheduled in VEMS.</p>
