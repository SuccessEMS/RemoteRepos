        <h1 class="mt-export-title">Configure Room Types</h1>
        <p class="Body">A<em> <span class="button">room type</span></em> is the class or category of the room, for example a meeting room, an auditorium, a workspace, a multi-purpose room, and so on. Users can use room types&#160;to filter search results.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>On the <MadCap:variable name="General.EMS&#160;Desktop Client" /> menu bar, click Configuration &gt; Facilities &gt; <strong>Room Types</strong>.&#160;The Room Types window opens. This window lists all the room types that are currently configured in your <MadCap:variable name="General.Product" /> database.</li>
        </ol>

        </p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Click <strong>New</strong>.&#160;The Room Type dialog box opens.</li>
            <li>In the <strong>Room Type</strong> field, enter a name or description for the new room type.&#160;The room type can be a maximum of 50 characters, including spaces.</li>
            <li>If you want <MadCap:variable name="General.EMS&#160;Web App" /> users to see this room type when they are searching for available space, leave <strong>Available to Everyday Users</strong>&#160;selected.</li>
            <li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.&#160;The Room Type dialog box closes. You return to the Room Types window with the newly configured room type automatically selected.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Tip: You Can Use "Override" Rooms to Classify Un-Configured Space</p>
        <p>An Override Room is used in EMS to loosely define useable space which is not formally configured. For example, a building may have private offices which are not configured as spaces available for public use, but you may need to select such a space for an attendee who is participating remotely in a video conference. In order to provide company employees the ability to schedule meetings in these private rooms, Override Rooms can be configured in EMS.</p>
        <h2>Configure an Override Room</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Name the space in a way that indicates an Override Room (for example, "Override Area1”).</li>
            <li>Classify the room as "Override Description.”</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In the example above, "Override Area 1” can be used repeatedly to serve as a placeholder for any meeting request which will occur in an un-configured space.</p>
        <p>For example, on Monday a user makes a reservation for "Override Area 1” and names it "Meeting in Mike Thompson’s Office,” and on Wednesday another user makes a reservation for "Override Area 1” and names it "Meet Guests in Lobby Reception Area Prior to Building Tour” EMS does not track availability for events booked in Override Rooms; however, EMS reports on events that are scheduled in an override room as it would for an event scheduled for any other room.</p>
