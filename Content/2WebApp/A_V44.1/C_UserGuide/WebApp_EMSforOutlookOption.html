        <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tip"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img alt="" class="internal default" /></td> <td> <p><strong>Concept: </strong>EMS for Outlook® is an optional (extra cost) purchase. If your organization has purchased it, then&#160;you will see the EMS plugin icon in your Outlook application. You will also see additional features and functionality in EMS. Further, anywhere that you see people or groups in EMS, you will have access to everyone in your organization's email database (which is stored in Exchange Server). This means that you can&#160;see people's availability (Out of Office, Busy, In a Meeting, etc.), send them email invitations or notices, and add EMS events to your Outlook calendar.</p> </td> </tr> </tbody></table>
