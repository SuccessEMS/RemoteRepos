        <h1 class="Title1">Creating a List of Favorite Rooms</h1>
        <p>Users can create a list of favorite rooms that can be searched for availability when creating a room request. This list of favorites is created in the&#160;<span class="span_1">My Account&#160;</span>section of the&#160;<span class="span_1">EMS Web App</span>. Once created in the Web App, the&#160;list of favorites will be displayed in the Facilities dropdown list on the Room Request page in EMS for Microsoft Outlook and the EMS Web App.&#160;If you leave the Facilities field set to this value, then all the rooms that are contained in this Favorites list are automatically searched for availability after you click Find Space.</p>
