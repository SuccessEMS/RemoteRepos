        <h1>Configuring Managed Space</h1>
        <p>Once you have <a title="Configuration &gt; Facilities">configured facilities</a> (rooms, categories, services, resources, and so on), you can configure special process templates for "managed space," which is meeting space that may require additional oversight and an approval process to finalize a reservation. For example, you may wish to configure a large banquet hall as managed space to ensure that any request to use it is approved by a supervisor. That supervisor would use the Dashboard from the {{product_dtc}} menu bar to view requests for space.&#160;</p>

        </p>
        <p>Typically, managed space involves services, expenses, and invoicing that affect&#160;multiple stakeholders and departments, and templates designed for this model are typically assigned to Everyday Users of {{product_webapp}}. By contrast, such templates are <strong>not </strong>recommended for assignment to {{product_emso}} users since Microsoft® Outlook does not show the request status&#160;of such a reservation.</p>
        <p><strong>Process Overview:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>To configure a process template to require supervisory approval:<em>&#160;</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>When defining an Everyday User Process template for a specialized type of space or room, you set the&#160;<strong>Request Status</strong>&#160;field to&#160;<em>Request&#160;</em>(so it will show as pending in the Dashboard).</li>
            <li>Assign that template to the appropriate everyday users (typically, {{product_webapp}} users so they can only Request reservations for that specialized space.</li>
            <li>Designate users in {{product_dtc}} who will <a target="_blank" title="Managing Requests for Managed Space">review and approve this type of space request in the Dashboard</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&#160;</p>
