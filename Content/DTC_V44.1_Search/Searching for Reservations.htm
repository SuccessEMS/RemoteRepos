        <h1>Search for Reservations, Bookings, Resources, and Service Orders</h1>
        <p>EMS has a variety of options available to you for searching for reservations, bookings, service orders, resources, and queries. These options include the Browser, the Everyday Reservation tool, the Calendar, the Navigator, a Group, the Resource Calendar, and the Service Order Management browser.</p>

            <li>Booking details&#160;are also called&#160;categories.</li>
            <li>Booking detail items, also called&#160;resources, are the individual items (coffee, sandwich, projector, and so on) that you add to a booking detail.</li>
