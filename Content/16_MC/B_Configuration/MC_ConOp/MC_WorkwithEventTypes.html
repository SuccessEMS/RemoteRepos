        <h1>Work with Event Types</h1>
        <p>An <em>e</em><em>vent type</em> is a colored label that you can apply to an event in Master Calendar to make it easier for your guests and users to distinguish between different events, know the purpose of an event, and find events. For example, if you are managing a calendar system for a university campus, your event types might include athletic events, invited speaker events, and so on. This topic guides you in&#160;defining new&#160;event types, editing event types, deleting event types, and&#160;activating and&#160;de-activating event types.</p>
