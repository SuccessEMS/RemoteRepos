        <p class="NormalWeb_3">EMS provides more than 110 reports and a custom query builder for use throughout the meeting and event lifecycle—from setup and invoicing to billing and utilization analysis. These&#160;"one-way integration" reports generate static reservation, service, billing, resource, and other information in .xml, .xls, comma-delimited, and&#160;.txt formats. This data&#160;can be read and parsed by many other&#160;software applications. These reports are categorized as follows:</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="li_1"><span class="mt-color-669933_1">Daily</span><span class="span_1">:&#160;Summary, service, and other reports that describe activities over one or more days.</span>
