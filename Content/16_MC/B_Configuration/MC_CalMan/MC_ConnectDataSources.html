        <h1>Connecting to Data Sources</h1>
        <p class="Body">Data Sources consist of Event Types, Holidays, and User-Defined fields defined in your EMS implementation.</p>
        <p><strong><span class="mt-color-669933">Process Overview:</span></strong>
        </p>

        </ul>
        <p class="Body">In Master Calendar, as the site administrator, you have the option of setting up event types and holidays (special dates) from “scratch;” however, if you are an existing EMS customer who uses one of the EMS products, such as Campus, Desktop Client, Enterprise, Professional, Legal, and so on, this means that you have already configured this information for your EMS application. Rather than creating these items from scratch, if your organization has purchased the optional module, Master Calendar Data Connectors, you can follow the steps in this topic&#160;to perform a one-time import of event types and holidays from your EMS application into Master Calendar. You can import event types and holidays from one or more EMS databases to one or more calendars in Master Calendar. Also, at the data source level, you can select a high-level view of your user-defined fields (UDFs) in your EMS database, and you can then run a connector to import one or more selected UDFs and their associated answers into your Master Calendar database. Managing data sources in Master Calendar consists of <span class="Link"><span style="text-decoration: none;">adding</span></span> data sources, <span class="Link"><span style="text-decoration: none;">deleting</span></span> data sources, <span class="Link"><span style="text-decoration: none;">importing</span></span> the event types, <span class="Link"><span style="text-decoration: none;">importing</span></span> the holidays, and <span class="Link"><span style="text-decoration: none;">selecting</span></span> the UDFs that are to be imported. You can also <span class="Link"><span style="text-decoration: none;">view</span></span> the history of event type mapping between your EMS database and your Master Calendar database.</p>

        <h2>Adding a data source</h2>
        <p>1. On the Admin menu, point to <strong>Site Administration</strong> &gt;&#160;<strong>Data Sources</strong>.&#160;The Data Sources page opens. This page lists all the currently available data sources in Master Calendar.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="StepNumberContinued">3. Add the information for the data source.</p>
        <p class="BulletLev2 mt-indent-1">• Description—The name of the database into which you are importing the event types and/or holidays.</p>
        <p class="BulletLev2 mt-indent-1">• Database Server Name—The name for the database server on which the EMS database from which you are importing the information resides.</p>
        <p class="BulletLev2 mt-indent-1">• Database Name—The name of the EMS database from which you are importing the event types and/or holidays.</p>
        <p class="StepNumberContinued">4. If appropriate, select the option <strong>EMS database resides on the same server or you are using a linked server</strong>.&#160;You can obtain the database server name and the database name by logging in to the EMS client and then choosing <strong>Select File</strong> &gt; <strong>Change Database</strong>, or you can work with your local Database Administrator to obtain the correct server name and database name.</p>
        <p class="StepNumberContinued">5. Click <strong>Test Data Source</strong>.&#160;If Master Calendar can connect to the specified EMS database, a message opens indicating that the “Connection succeeded.” Otherwise, the message indicates that the “Connection failed,” and provides a reason for the failure. You must make the necessary changes to the data connector, and test the connection again.</p>
        <p class="StepNumberContinued">6. After the message indicates that the “Connection succeeded,” click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>

Select the data sources that you are deleting.&#160;To select all data sources on the currently opened page for deletion in a single step, select Description. If you have multiple pages of data sources to delete, you must repeat this entire process on each page.</p>
        <p class="StepNumberContinued">3. Under Actions, click <strong>Delete</strong>.&#160;A message opens, informing you that all connectors that use this data source and associated events are deleted and asking you if you are sure that you want to continue.</p>
        <p class="StepNumberContinued">4. Click <strong>OK </strong>in the message.&#160;A message opens indicating that all the selected data sources were successfully deleted.</p>
        <p class="StepNumberContinued">5. Click <strong>OK </strong>in the message.&#160;The Data Sources page is refreshed to show the remaining, if any, data sources in Master Calendar.</p>
        <h2>Importing&#160;EMS event types</h2>
        <p class="Body">When you are importing event types from EMS into Master Calendar, you have three options. You can:</p>
        <p class="BulletLev1 mt-indent-1">• Map an EMS event type to an existing Master Calendar event type.</p>
        <p class="BulletLev1 mt-indent-1">• Create an EMS event type in Master Calendar if it doesn’t already exist.</p>
        <p class="BulletLev1 mt-indent-1">• Indicate that you do not want to import the EMS event type.</p>
        <p class="StepNumberBegin">1. On the Admin menu, point to Site Administration, and then click Data Sources.The Data Sources page opens. This page lists all the currently available data sources in Master Calendar.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="StepNumberContinued">2. Select the data source from which you are importing the event types and then, under Actions, click Event Types.&#160;The Event Types page opens. This page lists all the currently defined event types for the selected data source. It also shows the mapping for each event type, or whether it has been set to “Do Not Use.” If an EMS event type has <em>not</em> been mapped to a Master Calendar event type, and it has <em>not</em> been set to “Do Not Use,” then the “Create” option is displayed for it in the Master Calendar Event Type list.</p>

        <p class="StepNumberContinued">3. For any of the unmapped EMS event types, click Create to open a Master Calendar dialog box. The Description tab on this dialog box lists all the currently active Master Calendar event types. The “Do Not Use” option is also displayed on this list.If you do not see the Master Calendar event type to which you want to map the EMS event type, either it has not been created, or it is currently inactive in Master Calendar. To add a new event type, or to activate a currently inactive event type, see <span class="Link">“<a title="Managing Event Types">To add an event type</a>”</span> or <span class="Link">“<a title="Managing Event Types">To activate an event type</a>”</span>.</p>

        <p class="StepNumberContinued">5. Optionally, for any of the currently mapped EMS event types, change the mapping, or set the mapping to “Do Not Use.”&#160;All EMS event types that you leave in a '&lt;Create&gt;' status will be created in Master Calendar when you save your event type mappings. On the Master Calendar main menu, select Admin &gt; Configuration &gt; Event Types to view a global list of all the event types that are being stored in your Master Calendar database, regardless of their data source.</p>
        <p class="StepNumberContinued">6. Click <strong>Save </strong>on the Master Calendar dialog box.&#160;The Master Calendar dialog box opens. You return to the Event Types page.</p>
        <p class="StepNumberContinued">7. Click <strong>Save </strong>on the Event Types page.&#160;A message opens asking you if you are sure that you want to save all the event types.</p>
