        <h2><strong>Exchange Room Integration (ERI)</strong>
        </h2>

<h3><strong>What Is ERI?</strong></h3>

<p>Exchange Room Integration (ERI) is a simplified integration tool that allows clients to utilize their EMS software to its fullest potential. ERI&#160;allows enhanced integration of resources and technology during the EMS booking process&#160;for managed spaces. Exchange Room Integration&#160;simplifies the booking process and provides a cohesive and powerful way to book and manage resources.&#160;EMS Exchange Room Integration will&#160;take your resource scheduling to the next level.</p>

<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Allows integration of third-party technology (e.g., videoconference device or display panels) to a booking in EMS by linking to a Microsoft<sup>® </sup>Exchange resource mailbox</li>
    <li>Automatically includes fixed-room resources in&#160;the room booking (e.g., collaboration devices) through the Microsoft<sup>® </sup>Exchange resource mailboxes</li>
    <li>Allows integration of non-fixed resources (e.g., Mobile Microsoft Surface Hubs) during the booking process</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>How ERI Works</strong></h3>

<p>Once an&#160;everyday user adds a technology/resource&#160;to a booking&#160;using EMS for Outlook, EMS Web App, or the EMS Mobile App, ERI will seamlessly integrate the resource to the booking through the Microsoft<sup>® </sup>Exchange resource&#160;(room/equipment) mailbox.&#160;With EMS Exchange Room Integration (ERI), allows users to book in-room resource technologies seamlessly.</p>
