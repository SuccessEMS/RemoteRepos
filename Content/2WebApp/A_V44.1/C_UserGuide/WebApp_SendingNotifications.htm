                        <p>Your Administrator can automate alerts&#160;to be sent to you (or groups of which you are a member) when changes or additions have been made in EMS for bookings and reservations,&#160;service orders, room types,&#160;setup types,&#160;user accounts, and so on. When you create a reservation or booking that has these&#160;notifications turned on, users will receive these alerts without requiring additional effort from you. Be sure to review these notification settings during the process of creating or modifying events.&#160;</p>

                        <li>These are either sent out automatically after a booking is made in EMS Web App, or manually from the EMS desktop client.</li>
                        <li>They contain the date/time/resources for the booking that was created.</li>
                        <li>These usually go to end users so they know when their event is and if they owe any money.</li>

                        <li>These are sent out automatically based on the filters on the notification rule:</li>
                        <li>There are five types of notification rules:</li>
