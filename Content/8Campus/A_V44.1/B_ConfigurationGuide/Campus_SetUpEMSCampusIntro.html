        <div class="WordSection1">
            <p>Academic Planning is an optional component of the <MadCap:variable name="General.My Company" /> that provides all the functionality that is necessary for Domain Schedulers to ensure that every class meets in a location and at a time that is acceptable to departments and professors. The system provides automatic room assignment within user-supplied parameters, integration with your SIS/ERP software, and efficient online collaboration tools. It also simplifies final exam scheduling and offers a selection of reports to streamline and analyze the room scheduling process. When added to the functionality that meeting and event staff already have access to, it provides a complete campus-wide space management package referred to as <MadCap:variable name="General.EMS Campus" />. This chapter <span>section </span>details the synchronization of the information in your Student Information System, or SIS, with the information in your <MadCap:variable name="General.My Company" /> database as well as the configuration of campus-specific data items for <MadCap:variable name="General.EMS Campus" />.</p>
