        <h1 class="Heading1">Working with a Query</h1>
        <p>A&#160;query&#160;is the primary mechanism for retrieving information from a database. A query consists of questions that are presented to the database in a predefined format. A Query Builder function is available from the Reports menu. You can use this function to&#160;<a href="https://success.emssoftware.com/001_Using_EMS__(V44.1)/Using_EMS_for_Microsoft®_Outlook/Using_EMS/EMS_Desktop_Client/070_Reports_and_Queries/040_Working_with_a_Query#RTF4372656174655f7175657279"><span class="Hyperlink">create</span></a>&#160;queries for retrieving information from your EMS database. When you create a query, you can name and save the query so that you can run the query at any time that you choose. You can create a query from a newly created query,&#160;or you can create a query by copying an existing query and editing the copied query as needed. You can also edit&#160;a query, delete&#160;a query, and view&#160;and print&#160;a query's filters.</p>
