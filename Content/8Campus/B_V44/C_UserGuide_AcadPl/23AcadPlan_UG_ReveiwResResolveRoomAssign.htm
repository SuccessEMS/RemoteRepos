If you open a course in the Navigator that is cross-listed or shares space with another course, the Navigator displays both sets of reservations and bookings. You can review the reservations that have been made for a course and if needed,&#160;<a href="https://success.emssoftware.com/001_Using_EMS__(V44.1)/Using_EMS_for_Microsoft®_Outlook/Using_EMS/EMS_Desktop_Client/130_Academic_Planning_EMS_Campus/205-Reviewing_Reservations_and_Resolving_Room_Assignments#RTF4368616e67696e675f636f75"><span class="Hyperlink_2">change</span></a>&#160;the course room (location) for one or more of its bookings.
