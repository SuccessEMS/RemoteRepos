        <h1 class="Heading1">Assigning Rooms</h1>
        <p>After you have completed pre-assignment of rooms and/or room optimization, four options are available to resolve room assignments:</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph"><a href="https://success.emssoftware.com/001_Using_EMS__(V44.1)/Using_EMS_for_Microsoft®_Outlook/Using_EMS/EMS_Desktop_Client/130_Academic_Planning_EMS_Campus/170-Assigning_Rooms#RTF41737369676e5f726f6f6d73" class="Hyperlink_3">Assign</a>. The Assign option lists all rooms regardless of availability or preferences. It is intended to provide a means for you to quickly assign a room without going through the search process.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph"><a href="https://success.emssoftware.com/001_Using_EMS__(V44.1)/Using_EMS_for_Microsoft®_Outlook/Using_EMS/EMS_Desktop_Client/130_Academic_Planning_EMS_Campus/170-Assigning_Rooms#RTF5365617263685f726f6f6d73" class="Hyperlink_3">Search</a>. The Search option initially lists any preferences and requirements that were specified during the Set Preferences mode. You can use these preferences as a basis for a room search or you can specify and/or clear other criteria to complete the room search.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph"><span class="Strong">Unassign</span>. The Unassign option removes the Assigned status for a course. You can then use the Assign option or the Search option to assign a different room to the course. The Unassign option is available after you assign a room to a course, or search for a room, and then assign it to a course.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph"><span class="Strong">Swap</span>. The Swap option allows you to swap the room assignments of two courses. The swap option is only available after selecting two courses that have identical meeting patterns&#160;<span class="Emphasis">and</span>that have been assigned to rooms.</li>
        </ul>
