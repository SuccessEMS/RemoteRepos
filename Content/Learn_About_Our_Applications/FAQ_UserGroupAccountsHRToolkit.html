<p class="mt-indent-2">If you use an HR Information System or HRIS, user and group profiles or "accounts" may already be maintained there. This toolkit eliminates the double-entry of this information, by synchronizing between your HRIS and EMS&#160;at your chosen frequency. This toolkit enables you to automate&#160;the creation, updating, and de-activation of user and group accounts in EMS. The HR Toolkit automatically transfers selected records to a staging database and then updates the appropriate tables in EMS. The toolkit saves time and enhances security, and enables the creation, maintenance, and inactivation of user and group accounts from an outside data source.&#160;<strong>See Also:</strong>&#160;EMS HR Toolkit <a class="F1" title="https://success.emssoftware.com/Admin_Guides_(V44.1)/EMS_Authentication%2C_Modules%2C_Services%2C_Interfaces%2C_and_Optional_Components/HR_Toolkit/Installing_HR_Toolkit/How_HR_Toolkit_Integrates_Your_User_Records">Integration Workflow</a> and&#160;<a class="F1" title="Introduction">Installation Overview</a>.&#160;</p>
