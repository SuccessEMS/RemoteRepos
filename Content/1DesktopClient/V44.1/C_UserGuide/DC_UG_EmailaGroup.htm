        <p>Whether your organization uses Microsoft Outlook or SMTP, you can always email an EMS group.</p>
        <p>Tip:&#160;If your organization uses Microsoft Outlook, you can continue to use this email system to send emails to EMS groups; otherwise, to email an EMS group using the SMTP option, your user account must have an email address.</p>
        <p>To email a group</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Search for the group that you are emailing. See “To search for a group and/or contact”.</li>
            <li>Do one of the following:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>On the Groups window, select the group and then click Email. Depending on how your system is configured, either a pre-addressed Outlook email form or a pre-addressed SMTP email form opens. The To field is populated with the email address that is defined for the group, but you can edit this value if needed. Go to Step 4.</li>
                <li>On the Groups window, select the group, and then click Open.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <p>The group-specific window opens. Go to Step 3.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>On the group-specific window, make sure that the group is selected in the left pane, and then click Email. Depending on how your system is configured, either a pre-addressed Outlook email form or a pre-addressed SMTP email form opens. The To field is populated with the email address that is defined for the group, but you can edit this value if needed.</li>
            <li>Complete and send the email as you normally would.</li>
        </ol>
