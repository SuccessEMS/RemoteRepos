        <h1 class="mt-export-title">Considerations for Buying Glance</h1>
        <p>You should consider the following when deciding whether to buy Glance:</p> <ol> <li>You need to know when the Glance app stops running&#160;by receiving an email notification (ideally),&#160;or by watching a central monitoring display. EMS does not provide this capability, however,&#160;so you should physically check your tablets&#160;to see if&#160;Glance has stopped.</li> <li>For the tablets running Glance, you need to know if the battery fails, or if connectivity has been lost, or if the operating system wants to update to a new version. EMS does not detect these conditions remotely. In order to monitor these issues, we recommend that you use a Mobile Device Management (MDM)&#160;system.</li>  </ol> <p>If you are running glance on an iPad, you should also consider:</p> <ol> <li>If the iPad's battery dies, the iPad will return to its home screen after you restore power. At that point, you must configure Guided Access&#160;again for the Glance app. To do so, follow the instructions&#160;<u><a title="https://success.emssoftware.com/EMS_V44/Installing_and_Setting_Up_EMS/EMS_Glance/Configuring_EMS_Glance/08-Known_Device_Configurations?action=edit&amp;mt-draft=true">here</a></u>.</li> <li>If a user&#160;presses the iPad's Home&#160;button, Guided Access&#160;displays a passcode screen. The screen&#160;disappears after fifteen seconds or if the user presses&#160;'Cancel.' Note that users should not be able to press any&#160;tablet buttons if you&#160;use a tablet enclosure.</li> <li>If a user&#160;presses both the iPad's Home&#160;and Sleep/Wake buttons simultaneously for 10 seconds, the iPad restarts. At that point, you must configure Guided Access again for the Glance app.&#160;To do so, follow the instructions&#160;<u><a title="https://success.emssoftware.com/EMS_V44/Installing_and_Setting_Up_EMS/EMS_Glance/Configuring_EMS_Glance/08-Known_Device_Configurations?action=edit&amp;mt-draft=true">here</a></u>. Note that users should not be able to press any tablet buttons if you use a&#160;tablet enclosure.</li> <li>iOS devices occasionally display&#160;notifications that a software update is available. There is no way to suppress update notifications. When this notification appears, the user can choose "Later" but the notification will appear again in 24 hours. If the user chooses "Install Now," the iPad downloads and installs the update and then restarts. At that point,&#160;you must configure Guided Access again for Glance. To do so, follow the instructions&#160;<u><a title="https://success.emssoftware.com/EMS_V44/Installing_and_Setting_Up_EMS/EMS_Glance/Configuring_EMS_Glance/08-Known_Device_Configurations?action=edit&amp;mt-draft=true">here</a></u>.</li>  </ol> <p>Considerations for running glance on an Android tablet:</p> <ol> <li>Ideally, Glance takes over the tablet so that it cannot be used for anything else. However,&#160;Android provides no capability to lock down the tablet in a way that's suitable for Glance. Therefore,&#160;we recommend deploying Glance with an Android app that puts the tablets in 'kiosk' mode. Placing the tablet in kiosk mode prevents users from accessing other applications and also disable the 'Home' button. We recommend that you purchase,&#160;install and configure the&#160;<u><span style="color: #0066cc;"><a class="external" href="http://www.kioware.com/kwl_android.aspx" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank" title="http://www.kioware.com/kwl_android.aspx">Kioware Lite</a></span></u>&#160;app.</li> <li>If you run Glance on a Samsung Tab A, users can&#160;power off the tablet by holding down the power button. If you have configured Kioware <u><a title="How to Configure Glance on your Tablet">according to our recommendations</a></u>, Glance will restart as soon as the tablet is powered on. To prevent users from pressing the home button, you must use the appropriate enclosure.</li>  </ol><hr class="mt-export-separator" /><p class="template:tag-insert"><strong>Page tags: </strong><a mt-export-translate="no">article:topic</a><a>EMS Glance</a><a>Implementing EMS Glance</a><a>EMS Glance Offline</a><a>Room Assignments</a><a>EMS Glance for Apple</a><a>IOS</a><a>EMS Glance on a a tablet</a><a>EMS tablet</a></p></body>
