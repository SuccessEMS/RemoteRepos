        <h1 class="mt-export-title">Override Existing Bookings Utility</h1>
        <p>In some situations, such as a building closure, a scheduled maintenance repair, a priority event, and so on, you might need to “bump” one or more bookings from their scheduled location. You&#160;use&#160;the Override Existing Bookings Utility to bump all the bookings that meet specific criteria and place them in a Conflict status. A new all day booking that uses the settings (Event Name, Event Type, and Group) that you specify is created in place of these bumped bookings.</p>
