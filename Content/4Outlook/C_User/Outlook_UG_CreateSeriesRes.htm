        <h1>Create a Series Reservation</h1>
        <p>A Series Reservation is a single reservation that includes multiple bookings. EMS for Outlook allows you to search for rooms that are available at a particular time on multiple days to create a series reservation. This section details the creation of a series reservation for a non-video conference meeting.
