        <p>You configure data for your EMS database in two major locations:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li>Configuration area—You define&#160;core&#160;data items (facilities, resources, billing, and so on) in the Configuration area.</li>
            <li>System Administration area—You define&#160;system administration&#160;data items (global user settings, security, tools, and so on) in the System Administration area.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/DTC_V44_GetStarted/Overview of Configuration.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 823px;height: 329px;" alt="https://success.emssoftware.com/@api/deki/files/5865/DTCAdminMenu.png?revision=1" />
        </p>
        <p>To be able to make reservations in EMS, at a minimum, you&#160;must&#160;configure buildings, rooms, statuses, and groups. By default, when you configure any data item, the item is configured as an&#160;active&#160;item, which means that it is available for use in the system. You can inactivate the vast majority of data items in the EMS database. When you inactivate a data item, it does not delete the item. All information about the item is retained for historical purposes; however, the item is no longer available for use in the system. For example, if you inactivate a room then the space is no longer available for booking, but it remains in place anywhere it was used before being inactivated. If needed, you can delete a data item, but only if the item has not been used in some way in your EMS system. For example, you can delete a room only if no bookings or guest requests reference the room. You can delete a resource only if no service order items reference the resource. Also, the procedure to edit existing data is identical to the procedure for configuring data with one difference—instead of clicking&#160;New&#160;in the &lt;Data&gt; window, you select the data that is being modified and then click&#160;Edit.&#160;With the exception of groups,&#160;this approach works for editing all data items in your EMS database.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Using Configuration Windows&#160;</h2>
        <p>For any configuration window:</p>
        <p>On some of the configuration windows, if you click&#160;Print, a list of reports that you can generate and print for the applicable configuration item opens. On other configuration windows,an onscreen report opens instead&#160;in a Print Preview window. This report simply lists the items you have configured. You can also print a hard copy of the report from this window.&#160;</p>
        <p>The Audit tab lists the date that the item was added to your EMS database and the name of the user who added the item. It also lists the date that the item was last modified in your EMS database and the name of the user who modified the item.&#160;&#160;</p>
