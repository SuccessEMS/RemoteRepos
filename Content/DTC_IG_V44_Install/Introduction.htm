        <h2 class="Heading2">What is the EMS Desktop Client?&#160;</h2>
        <p>The EMS Desktop Client is an application that is installed on administrative&#160;users' desktops. Administrative users use this application to configure various workflows, as well as manage day-to-day operations within the application.</p>
        <h3 class="Heading3">Understanding&#160;User Types&#160;</h3>
        <p>There are two different user types in&#160;EMS.</p>
        <p>

        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li>Administrators:&#160;These users create and maintain the EMS application within your organization, and manage or approve usage of space. This user type may&#160;also include Service Providers (Catering, Audio Visual, IT Support Staff), Security, and Receptionist Staff. These users will primarily use the EMS Desktop Client.</li>
            <li>Everyday Users:&#160;This is a majority of the users in the organization. Everyday users are&#160;typically requesting rooms and services. These users do not use the Desktop Client, they will primarily use the web based application, VEMS in V44, EMS Web App in V44.1.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4 class="Heading4">EMS System Architecture</h4>
        <p>The EMS Desktop Client is the foundation for a broad range of components,&#160;services, web applications, APIs, add-ons, and integrations.</p>

        <h2 class="Heading2">Upgrading?&#160;</h2>
        <p>If you are upgrading to a newer version of EMS, please encourage users at your facility to read the release notes&#160;before they begin working with the new version of the software. Doing so will minimize the amount of time it takes them to get “up-to-speed” with the new release and help them benefit from new features and functions that they might not otherwise discover.&#160;</p>
        <p>IMPORTANT:&#160;&#160;All&#160;the EMS-related components you have licensed&#160;must be upgraded with this release.&#160;</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Product Registration&#160;</h2>
        <p>Primary Contacts can obtain the license file from the Support Center area on&#160;<a href="http://www.emssoftware.com/" title="http://www.emssoftware.com/"><span class="Hyperlink">www.emssoftware.com</span></a>.&#160; This license file is required to activate your EMS software and is required for new and existing customers.</p>
