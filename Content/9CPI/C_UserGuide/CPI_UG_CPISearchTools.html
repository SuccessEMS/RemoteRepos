        <h1>EMS Campus Planning Interface Search Tools</h1>
        <p>The EMS Campus Planning Interface has three search tools:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Academic Browser</strong>:&#160;Allows you to&#160;search for courses or course dates.</li>
            <li><strong>Academic Book</strong>: Provides a week-at-a-glance graphical view of the courses that are assigned to a specific room or instructor.</li>
            <li><strong>Search for Rooms tool</strong>: Simplifies the process of searching for classrooms.&#160;</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You use the Academic Book and the Academic Browser to search for courses. The tools differ in how they present their search results and the options that are available for working with the search results. You use the Search for Rooms tool to search for available rooms. After a term is published, there are times when the specific rooms that are available for a particular meeting pattern and set of criteria must be identified. For example, you might need to add a new section for a course or you might be looking to change the times for a course. The Search for Rooms tool significantly simplifies the process of searching for classrooms in these situations.</p>
        <p>This section will provide information on:</p>

        <h2><strong><a id="SearchwithAcademicBrowser" name="SearchwithAcademicBrowser"></a>To search using the Academic Browser:</strong>
        </h2>
        <p>You can use the Academic Browser to search for courses or course dates. The results are displayed in a list view. After the search results are returned, you have a variety of options for working with the results, including sorting and grouping information or using the Tools menu to perform functions. The actions that you can carry out in the Academic Browser depend upon the mode (Define &amp; Edit Courses, Set Preferences, Dual Mode, or Read Only) that has been set in EMS Campus for the academic term with which you are working.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>On the <strong>Term Details</strong> page menu bar, click <strong>Academic Browser</strong>. The Academic Browser page opens. The page lists all the courses for all academic units (departments) without course dates and all courses for all academic units with course dates (meeting patterns) that have been defined for the selected term. “Multiple” is displayed for those courses with more than one course date. Canceled courses are displayed with a strikethrough.</li>
