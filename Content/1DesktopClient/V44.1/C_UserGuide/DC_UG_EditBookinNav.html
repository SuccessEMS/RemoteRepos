        <h1>Edit a Booking in the Navigator</h1>
        <p>When you edit a booking in the Navigator, you are working with the&#160;when&#160;and&#160;where&#160;information for the event: the event time, the event location, and so on. To edit a booking, you must have the appropriate security access. For example, you cannot move a booking to a room if your EMS administrator has not granted you access to the room. Likewise, you cannot change the status for a booking from Tentative to Confirmed if your EMS administrator has not granted you access to the Confirmed status. If you cannot change a booking and you have appropriate permissions, it may be&#160;<a href="https://success.emssoftware.com/EMS_V44.1/Working_With_Reservations_And_Bookings/Why_is_the_Booking_Locked%3F" title="Booking Locked">locked</a>.&#160;</p>

        <p>Tips:&#160;If you have access, you can&#160;change the status of a booking, including cancelling a booking.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you change the status for a booking, you can select&#160;Update Reservation Status&#160;to change the reservation-level status to match.</li>
            <li>If you edit a video conference, any date and time changes you make to the booking automatically cascade to all related bookings.</li>
        </ul>
        <ol start="4">
            <li>On the Booking tab, edit the information for the booking as needed, and then click&#160;OK.&#160;<ul><li>If you edited anything other than the date, time, or location&#160;for a booking, the Booking window closes and you return to the Navigator, which now shows the updated information for the booking.</li><li>If you cancel&#160;a booking, a Cancel Status dialog box opens in which you must identify the user who canceled the booking and provide notes (for example, a cancellation reason) about the cancelation.</li><li>If you edited the date, time, or location&#160;for a booking, a dialog box opens, warning you that critical booking information has changed and asking you if you want to continue. Click&#160;Yes.&#160;The Booking window closes and you return to the Navigator, which now shows the updated information for the booking.&#160;If you reserved a resource, a Resource Inventory Conflicts report then opens. If you close this report, you can manually run a Resource Inventory Conflict check. In the Bookings folder of the Navigator, select Tools &gt; Resource Inventory Conflict. &#160;</li></ul></li>
