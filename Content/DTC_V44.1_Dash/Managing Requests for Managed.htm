        <h1 class="Heading1">Managing Requests for Managed Space</h1>
        <p>This topic guides you in approving "pending requests," which are requests for space that require supervisory approval and appear in your Dashboard.&#160;</p>
        <p>Concept:&#160;You Use the Request/Approval Model to Oversee "Managed Space"&#160;</p>
        <p>Once your system administrator has&#160;<a href="https://success.emssoftware.com/EMS_V44.1/Installing_and_Setting_Up_EMS/EMS_Desktop_Client/Setting_Up_EMS_Desktop_Client/040_Core_Configuration_-_Facilities" title="Configuration &gt; Facilities"><span class="Hyperlink">configured facilities</span></a>&#160;(rooms, categories, services, resources, and so on), he or she can configure special process templates for "managed space," which is meeting space that may require additional oversight and an approval process to finalize a reservation. For example, your organization may need specialized space like the Presiden'ts Conference room, or a large banquet hall, to be treated&#160;as managed space to ensure that any request to use it is approved by a supervisor.&#160;Typically, managed space involves services, expenses, and invoicing that affect&#160;multiple stakeholders and departments, and templates designed for this model are typically assigned to Everyday Users of EMS Web App. By contrast, such templates are&#160;not&#160;available for EMS for Outlook&#160;users since Microsoft® Outlook does not show the&#160;request status&#160;of such a reservation.&#160;</p>
