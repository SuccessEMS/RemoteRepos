        <h1 class="Heading1">Managing Service Orders</h1>
        <p>You use Manage Services to search for&#160;and view the resources with and without service orders for all bookings on a particular day as well as the current state of the resources and their Reviewed status. After viewing a resource, if applicable, you can change the state for a resource. You can review a resource, or you can mark a resource as un-reviewed. You can also open a resource in the Navigator, and edit it if necessary.</p>
        <p>Concept:&#160;What is a Service Order, Category, and Resource? (click to expand)</p>
        <p>In EMS, you may hear these terms used&#160;interchangeably sometimes, however, they are different concepts.</p>
        <p>A&#160;Category&#160;in EMS is anything you might add to a Booking such as Catering, Audio Visual, Furniture, Security, Notes, Attendee Names, Agendas etc.&#160;When you configure a Category, however, it must be of six&#160;Category&#160;types:&#160;Activities, Attendees, Catering, Notes, Resources with Service Orders, or Resources Without Service Orders. These types cause the service to&#160;behave slightly differently when&#160;added to a booking. For example, a Notes/Activities/Attendees&#160;type service category&#160;does not require the EMS Administrator to configure items&#160;under it and there is nothing for a person to “select” from these types of services.</p>
        <p>By contrast, a&#160;service category that has a type of&#160;Catering,&#160;Resource with Service Order, or a Resource without a&#160;Service Order Category,&#160;will require the Administrator to create items&#160;under it. For example, an&#160;"AV Equipment" service category (configured as a Resource without a Service Order Category type) might have items under it such as a flip chart, whiteboard, (under AV Equipment).&#160;The person requesting the service for this meeting would then select&#160;AV equipment; then&#160;flipchart&#160;and&#160;whiteboard&#160;would be typical options to add to the event.&#160;</p>
