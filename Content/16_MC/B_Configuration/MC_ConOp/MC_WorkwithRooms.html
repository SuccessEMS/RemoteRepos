        <h1>Work with Rooms</h1>
        <p>Within <a title="Working With Event Locations">Locations</a>, you can specify a <em>room</em>, which&#160;is a further definition/clarification of where an event is to take place. For example, if you specify a building as the event location for a chemistry lab practical, a room could specify a specific&#160;lab room in the building for that event. Your Master Calendar parameter settings control whether the room field shows for users&#160;under&#160;a&#160;Location. <strong>See Also</strong>: <a title="Default Page Configuration Settings">Default Page Configuration Settings</a>.</p>
