        <p>Resources are grouped by category. For example, a furniture category might contain tables and chairs as the resources. Although you can use categories to track setup notes, meeting attendees, and activities for a booking, you do not configure resources for these categories. You must configure&#160;resources only for service categories.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li>On the EMS menu bar, click Configuration &gt;&#160;Resources.&#160;A list of all the categories that are currently configured in your EMS database&#160;and&#160;for which you can configure resources opens.&#160;If the appropriate category is not listed, you can configure it.</li>
            <li>Select the category for which you are configuring the resources. The Resources window opens. This window lists all the resources that are currently configured in your EMS database for the selected category and that have a status of Active.</li>

As a result, when you are configuring a group of similar items, you might want to start the name of each with a common feature. For example, if you have black, white, and blue linens, a good way to name them would be “Linens, black,” “Linens, white,” and so on.</p>

        <p>A&#160;package&#160;is a group of resources.&#160;You can combine a list of related resources into a&#160;package&#160;to streamline booking. For example, an Instructor A/V package might include a laser pointer, a mobile microphone, and a flip chart. You select the items for a resource package on the Package Items tab of the Resource dialog box. You can set the price for a package to be the sum total of the individual resources that make up the package, or you can set an independent price for the package.</p>
