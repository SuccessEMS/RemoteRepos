        <h1>Overview of the Academic Scheduling Process</h1>
        <p>The academic scheduling process is a multi-step process for enabling online communication between the Domain Scheduler and academic units, optimizing academic space use, and creating reservations in EMS Academic Planning for academic courses. To use the full functionality of EMS Academic Planning, it is important that you understand the&#160;<a href="https://success.emssoftware.com/001_Using_EMS__(V44.1)/Using_EMS_for_Microsoft®_Outlook/Using_EMS/EMS_Desktop_Client/130_Academic_Planning_EMS_Campus/010-Overview_of_the_Academic_Scheduling_Process#RTF41636164656d69635465726d"><span class="Hyperlink_2">academic&#160;</span></a><span class="link">scheduling specific terms</span>&#160;that are used in EMS Academic Planning and that you have a high-level understanding of the&#160;<a href="https://success.emssoftware.com/001_Using_EMS__(V44.1)/Using_EMS_for_Microsoft®_Outlook/Using_EMS/EMS_Desktop_Client/130_Academic_Planning_EMS_Campus/010-Overview_of_the_Academic_Scheduling_Process#RTF4153435f70726f63657373"><span class="Hyperlink_2">a</span></a><span class="link">cademic scheduling configuration process</span>.</p>

        <p>While meeting/event scheduling and academic scheduling have many features in common, EMS Academic Planning uses terms that are specific to the academic scheduling configuration process.</p>

Functions such as synchronizing, optimizing, and running reports are carried out on a per domain basis. (A user who has this type of access is referred to as a Domain Scheduler.)

The subjects that are defined within an academic unit determine the courses that are listed when filtering by the unit. Academic units are used when assigning permissions to Academic users and when filtering reports.
