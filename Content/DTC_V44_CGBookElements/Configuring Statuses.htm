        <p>A&#160;status&#160;indicates the likelihood that a booking will occur. You can apply a status to both bookings and reservations, but only booking-level statuses affects room availability. Every booking must have a status. Examples of statuses include “Confirmed,” “Tentative,” “Wait List,” and “Canceled.” A status is one of four core data items that you must configure so that your users can make reservations. You can&#160;<a href="https://success.emssoftware.com/Older_Releases_(V44%2C_V43)/EMS_Version_44/Installing_and_Setting_Up_EMS/EMS_Desktop_Client/Setting_Up_EMS_Desktop_Client/050_Core_Configuration_-_Administration/080_Configuring_Calendar_Formats#RTF436f6e6669677572696e675f"><span class="Hyperlink">configure</span></a>&#160;as many statuses as you need and give them any names you want; however, you must always assign one of the four following&#160;status typesto a status:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: square;margin-left: 36pt;">
            <li>Book Space</li>
            <li>Wait</li>
            <li>Info Only</li>
            <li>Cancel</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The name that you assign to a status is just a convenient label that assists you in managing your organization’s business. The status type is what is actually used by EMS to determine if a room must be taken out of inventory.</p>
