        <h1>Enable or Disable a Term for Define and Edit Mode</h1>
        <p>After you have imported a term and synchronized the courses for the term, you can set the mode to Define &amp; Edit and&#160;make&#160;the term available to the academic units. You have the&#160;option of selecting Define and Edit mode, or Dual mode. Dual mode enables a term for both Define &amp; Edit Mode and Set Preference mode at the same time. If you select Define and Edit mode, then the steps that you carry out during this mode are distinct and unique from the steps that you carry out in the next mode, which is the Set Preferences mode. If you select Dual mode, then you can carry out the steps for both modes at the same time.</p>
