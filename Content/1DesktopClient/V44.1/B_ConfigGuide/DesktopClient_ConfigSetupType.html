        <h1>Configure Setup Types</h1>
        <p><span class="button">Setup type</span> is the physical layout or arrangement of a room, for example, classroom, conference, theater-style, rounds of 6, as-is, and so on. Setup types predefine rooms for a smoother booking process. Although configuring setup types is not required, setup type is used for defining the capacity for a room, which is helpful information for the staff at your organization who prepare rooms for an event. Also, when you configure a room, you can note, by setup type, the capacity for the room. When searching for available space, your users can use setup types and capacities to filter their search results.</p>
