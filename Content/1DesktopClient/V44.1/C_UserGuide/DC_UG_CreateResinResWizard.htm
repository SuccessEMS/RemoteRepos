You can search for rooms that are available for a particular time on one day (a simple reservation with one booking) or on multiple days (a series reservation with multiple bookings).

Remember, setup and teardown times are the hours, or fractions of hours, that you add to the event time to allow staff to prepare a room for the event or to clean up after the event. For example, for a 30 minute setup time, you can enter 30 minutes or 0.5 hours.</li>
