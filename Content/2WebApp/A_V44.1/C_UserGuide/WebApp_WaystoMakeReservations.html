EMS lets you have&#160;multiple bookings under a single reservation.

For example, the Academic Planning Board schedules the conference room (the where) for a staff meeting on the second Monday in January (the when). The Academic Planning Board&#160;now has a single reservation with a single booking in EMS. If, however, they schedule&#160;the conference room (the where) for a staff meeting on the second Monday of each month for a year (the when), then the board now has a single reservation with 12 bookings.</span><span class="span_3">B</span><span class="span_3">ooking Details&#160;</span><span class="span_1">A booking can have one or more booking details associated with it.&#160;</span><span class="Emphasis_1">Booking details</span><span class="span_1">&#160;are the resources (items for the meeting)&#160;or services (people and their activities)&#160;that are needed for an event, the notes for the event, the activities for the event, the room charges for the event, or any combination of these. For example, for the Academic Planning Board’s staff meeting, the resources could&#160;include catering (coffee service, bagels and muffins, and so on) and A/V equipment, plus the services of&#160;a person bringing in and setting up a projector, moving&#160;a speaker’s podium, and so on). &#160;</span>Service Orders&#160;System Administrators configure "buckets" of these details as "Categories," which streamlines the process of adding details to bookings.&#160;<span class="span_4"><img src="../../../Resources/Images/ReservationsBookings/Reservations Bookings and_1.png" style="height: 50px;width: 50px;" alt="https://success.emssoftware.com/@api/deki/files/3858/tech_doc_overview.png?revision=1&amp;size=bestfit&amp;width=26&amp;height=29" class="img_1" /></span><span class="span_4">&#160;</span><span class="span_4">Concept:</span><span class="span_4">&#160;Services, Categories, and Resources: What's the Difference?

These types cause the service to&#160;behave slightly differently when&#160;added to a booking. For example, a Notes/Activities/Attendees&#160;type service category&#160;does not require the EMS Administrator to configure items&#160;under it and there is nothing for a person to “select” from these types of services.</span><span class="span_1">By contrast, a&#160;service category that has a type of&#160;Catering,&#160;Resource with Service Order, or a Resource without a&#160;Service Order Category,&#160;will require the Administrator to create items&#160;under it. For example, an&#160;"AV Equipment" service &#160;category (configured as a Resource without a Service Order Category type) might have items under it such as a flip chart, whiteboard, (under AV Equipment).&#160;The person requesting the service for this meeting would then select&#160;</span><span class="Emphasis_1">AV equipment</span><span class="span_1">; then&#160;</span><span class="Emphasis_1">flipchart&#160;</span><span class="span_1">and&#160;</span><span class="Emphasis_1">whiteboard&#160;</span><span class="span_1">would be typical options to add to the event.&#160;</span><span class="span_1">Furthermore, a Category can&#160;</span><a href="https://success.emssoftware.com/?title=Installation_%26_Setup_Guides/EMS_Client_V44.1/Setting_Up_EMS_Desktop_Client/050_Core_Configuration_-_Administration/010_Configuring_Categories" title="https://success.emssoftware.com/EMS_V44.1/Installing_and_Setting_Up_EMS/EMS_Desktop_Client/Setting_Up_EMS_Desktop_Client/050_Core_Configuration_-_Administration/010_Configuring_Categories"><span class="Hyperlink_1">be configured&#160;to "Use States"&#160;</span></a><span class="span_1">so that when a service is requested with a meeting, it can be managed through a review and approval process in the Manage Services toolbar option&#160;</span><span class="span_1"><img src="../../../Resources/Images/ReservationsBookings/Reservations Bookings and_3.png" style="height: 53px;width: 97px;" alt="https://success.emssoftware.com/@api/deki/files/5970/clipboard_e9d0b1d823c09fb0734a820c64ddd5789.png?revision=1&amp;size=bestfit&amp;width=61&amp;height=33" class="img_1" /></span><span class="span_1">&#160;in EMS Desktop Client.&#160;</span>See Also:&#160;<a href="https://success.emssoftware.com/EMS_V44.1/Working_With_Reservations_And_Bookings/Working_With_Your_Reservations%3A_The_Navigator/030_Adding_Services%2C_Equipment%2C_and_Resources_to_a_Meeting" title="Adding Services, Equipment, and Resources to a Meeting" class="Hyperlink_1">Adding Services&#160;</a><p>&#160;</p><hr class="mt-export-separator" /><p class="template:tag-insert"><strong>Page tags: </strong><a mt-export-translate="no">article:topic</a><a>screenreshoot</a><a>QAReview</a><a>revisedjan</a></p></body>
