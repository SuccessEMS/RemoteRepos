        <h1 class="Heading1">Working with Invoices</h1>
        <p>You can generate an invoice in EMS Desktop Client based on a specific booking date or date range, a reservation number, or both. For example, you can generate invoices for all bookings from May 1 through May 14, for all bookings in reservation number 22, or for all bookings in reservation number 22 that occurred between May 1 and May 14. You can generate multiple invoices for the same booking, with each invoice showing the charges for a different category (such as room charges on one invoice, catering charges on another invoice, and so on). This might be necessary in situations in which you must produce multiple invoices for the same booking if the departments within your organization bill separately for the services they provide. You can also reprint an invoice and void an invoice.</p>
        <p>You can work with invoices for a single reservation, or you can batch process multiple invoices. If you want to work with invoices for a single reservation, you do so through the Transactions tab in the Navigator. If you want to work with a batch of invoices, you do so through the EMS Desktop Client Billing menu: Billing &gt; Invoices &gt;&#160;Invoicing.</p>
        <h2 class="Heading2">Generating an Invoice&#160;</h2>
        <p>Tip: Before you generate an invoice, you should generate the Billing Worksheet report.

        <p>After you generate and post an invoice, the message “Items have been invoiced” is displayed in red text on the Reservation Summary tab, the Booking Summary tab, and the &lt;Booking Detail&gt; Summary tab in the Navigator. The booking detail folder in which the invoiced items reside now has a green background in the Booking Details pane and the icon for each invoiced item also has a green background in the Items pane. Also, the invoice is permanently saved, and you cannot edit it. You can make changes to the balance due for a reservation only by creating an adjustment or by voiding the invoice and regenerating it after you edit the booking information. (Because invoiced bookings are locked and cannot be edited, you must void the invoice before you can edit the bookings.)</p>
