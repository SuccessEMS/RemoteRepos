        <p>You can generate a Manage Events List report, which lists all the events to which you have&#160;access as a Master Calendar manager. You can generate a report that lists all the pending&#160;events for all calendars to which you have access as a Master Calendar manager or you can&#160;generate a report for events with different statuses.</p> <p>1. On the Admin menu, point to Events &amp; Special Dates, and then click Manage Events.&#160;The Manage Events page opens. When this page first opens, the list of events that<br />appears is a list of all pending events for all calendars to which you have access as a&#160;Master Calendar manager.</p> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>Manage Events page</em></p> <p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img src="../../images/B_Configuration/MC_GenerateListEventRequests_ManageEventsPage.png" xmlns:MadCap="http://www.madcapsoftware.com/Schemas/MadCap.xsd" style="width: 1156px;height: 380px;" /></p> <p>2.
