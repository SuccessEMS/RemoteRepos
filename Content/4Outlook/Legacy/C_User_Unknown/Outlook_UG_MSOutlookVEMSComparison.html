        <div class="EXPAND_CLASS">The EMS for Outlook plugin module provides one-click access to self-service room reservation and resource booking using the familiar Outlook personal scheduling interface. Users can find available rooms, reserve them and book resources—such as A/V equipment or catering—all from within Microsoft Outlook.</div>
        <p>Virtual EMS (VEMS) provides robust, real-time access to scheduling information via an internet browser. A broad range of scheduling options and scheduling scenarios are supported easily. Authorized users can, depending on the level of access granted, submit room requests or create self-service reservations directly. Users can create basic or advanced reservations, schedule resources, view building schedules, or search for specific events.</p>
        <p>Some important points to note about the EMS for Outlook plugin module as compared to Microsoft Outlook and VEMS are the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The module is designed for the basic scheduling of rooms and resources that require no official approval (“unmanaged” space).</li>
            <li>The module is not designed to be an administrative tool. For complex room reservations and resource management, Virtual EMS (VEMS) or the EMS Desktop client application is required.</li>
            <li>Simple routine reservations made using the EMS for Outlook plugin module generally follow the same rules as simple Outlook reservations.</li>
            <li>The module supports existing Outlook delegation rules and assignments.</li>
            <li>The module can be used just like Microsoft Outlook to schedule regular recurring appointments (day and time).</li>
            <li>Just like VEMS reservations, EMS for Outlook reservations abide by the rules of the Web Process template and the VEMS settings of the applicable categories and resources. The ability to modify and cancel EMS for Outlook reservations (dates, time, rooms, services and/or resources) are determined by these rules and the restrictions of Microsoft Outlook and Exchange.</li>
        </ul>
