        <p>Upgrading the EMS Server Components</p>
        <p>The server upgrade process will upgrade the EMS databases on your MS SQL Server. If you are upgrading from EMS Enterprise 4.x or below, your existing EMSEnterprise_Master database (which contains licensing information) will be replaced by a new EMS_Master database, and your existing EMS database will be upgraded to the current version.</p>
        <p>Note:  A Microsoft SQL Server SA level account will be required to execute the database upgrade process.</p>
        <p>Download the EMS.ServerInstall.exe file from the EMS Support Portal.</p>
        <p>Using SQL Server Management Studio, back up your existing EMS databases.</p>
        <p>Run EMS.ServerInstall.exe. (This .exe can be run from any PC that has access to your database server.)</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>

        <p>In the Database field, enter the name of the EMS database you wish to upgrade.</p>
        <p>In the Server Authentication area, specify your MS SQL Server authentication credentials.  If SQL Server Authentication Mode is selected, you will be required to specify a User Name and Password.</p>

        <p>&#160;</p>
