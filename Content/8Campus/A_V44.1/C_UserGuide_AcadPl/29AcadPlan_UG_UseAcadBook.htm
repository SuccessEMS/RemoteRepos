        <h1>Using the Academic Book</h1>
        <p class="body_1">The Academic Book provides a week-at-a glance graphical view of the courses that are assigned to a specific room or instructor. The view is for one room at a time as opposed to the Reservation Book, which shows all rooms one day at a time. The Academic Book shows only classes during the Planning phase of academic scheduling, but it shows both classes and events post-publish. To open the Academic Book, do one of the following:</p>
        <ul class="ul_2">
            <li class="ListParagraph">On the EMS Academic Planning toolbar, click the Academic Book icon&#160;<img src="../../../Resources/Images/AcademicPlanV44/AcademicPlanV44_25.png" style="height: 54px;width: 86px;" alt="emsum_EMSCampus_image087.png" class="img_1" />.</li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">On the EMS Academic Planning menu bar, click Academic Planning &gt; Courses &gt; Academic Book.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>When the Academic Book first opens, if you are working with a future term, then the date is set to the first Sunday or Monday of a full week of the term; otherwise, if you are working with a current term, then the date is set to the first Sunday or Monday of the current week.</p>
