        <p>Tips:&#160;&#160;You can use the&#160;Hide Cancelled Bookings&#160;and&#160;Hide Old Bookings&#160;options to adjust the data.</p>
        <p>The start date you specify becomes the date of the first new booking. In addition, the copied bookings are scheduled according to the same pattern as the existing reservation. For example, if the existing reservation has three bookings and each booking was scheduled every seven days (12/14, 12/21, and 12/28), and the new start date for the first booking is 12/18, then the existing or new reservation has three bookings with dates of 12/15, 12/22, and 12/29.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="7">
            <li>Select the booking(s) that you wish to copy to the existing or new reservation (you can click&#160;Select All&#160;to select all the displayed bookings in a single step), and then click&#160;Finish.&#160;A message confirms that the changes were made successfully.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Tip: When you copy multiple bookings, they are are simply copied and pasted "as-is":&#160;bookings are not moved to a different location. If you need to move a booking to a different location, see&#160;<a href="https://success.emssoftware.com/EMS_V44.1/Working_With_Reservations_And_Bookings/Working_With_Your_Reservations:_The_Navigator/024_Editing_Multiple_Bookings_in_the_Navigator#Changing_Rooms" title="EMS_V44.1/Using_EMS/Using_EMS_Desktop_Client/080_Reservations_and_Bookings/Working_With_Your_Reservations%3A_The_Navigator/080_Editing_Multiple_Bookings_in_the_Navigator"><span class="Hyperlink">Changing Rooms for Multiple Bookings</span></a>.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="8">
            <li>Click&#160;OK&#160;to close the message and return to the Navigator.&#160;The reservation from which you copied the bookings and the reservation to which you copied the bookings are displayed in the left pane of the Navigator. If you moved the bookings to a new reservation, then the new reservation that is created is assigned the next available reservation number in the database. If any of the new bookings are in conflict with bookings in the existing reservation, this conflict is indicated in the Navigator.</li>
