        <h1 class="mt-export-title">Introduction to the EMS Room Sign App</h1>
        <p>The EMS Room Sign App (formerly named EMS Glance) is an optional web-based application that turns your tablet (e.g., iPad, iPad mini, etc.) into a digital room sign.  Mounted outside of a meeting room or workspace in either landscape or portrait orientations, the application indicates whether a space is available or in use.  The application also provides functionality to support check-in, end, extend and book new meetings.</p>
        <p>The EMS Room Sign App  gives users real-time information and at-a-glance availability for their meeting, learning, and working spaces. The new, redesigned EMS Room Sign App includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A clean, color-coded interface that’s easy to scan for information</li>
            <li>Simplified buttons and options, with fewer steps to make or edit reservations</li>
            <li>Landscape and portrait orientations, including an Agenda View of the day’s events</li>
            <li>Easier customization for your organization’s branding</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: Please note that your EMS Room Sign App purchase only includes the software application itself; not the device, mounting accessories (enclosures, power supplies, etc.) or physical installation.</p>
