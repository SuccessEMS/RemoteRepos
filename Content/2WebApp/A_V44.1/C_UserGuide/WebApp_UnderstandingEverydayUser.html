        <h2>Why are some features in EMS unavailable to me? Why can't I book a room?&#160;</h2>
        <p>Your Administrator controls what you are able to do and view in EMS using "everyday user templates" based on your user profile. The options and information you can see in EMS depends on your security access, user type, and many other administrative controls.&#160;</p>
        <p>Additionally, your capabilities are also controlled by your "booking templates" and permissions. Learn more about these settings here: <a title="Making Reservations">Booking Templates, Requests, and Reservations</a>.</p>
        <p>Note: If you have previously used older versions of EMS, you may know these templates as "Web Process Templates." These are now called "Everyday User Process Templates."</p>
