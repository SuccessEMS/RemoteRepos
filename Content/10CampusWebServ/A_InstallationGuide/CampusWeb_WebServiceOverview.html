        <h1>Web Service Overview</h1>
        <h2><a name="_Toc385925072"></a>EMS Campus Application Architecture</h2> <p>The EMS Campus Web Service communicates with the SIS database via views.&#160; An installation script is provided during your implementation that will be executed against your SIS database to create the necessary views.&#160; The EMS Campus Web Service interacts directly with these views to handle all querying and updating room assignments.</p><![CDATA[  ]]><h2><a name="_Toc385925073"></a>EMS-SIS Data Synchronization</h2> <p>The EMS Campus Web Service synchronizes the following information from the SIS:</p> <p><strong>Facility Information</strong></p> <ul> <li>Buildings (via ems_vwBuildings view)</li> <li>Room Types (via ems_vwRoomTypes view)</li> <li>Rooms (via ems_vwRooms view)</li></ul> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; <strong>Course Related Information</strong></p> <ul> <li>Subjects (via ems_vwSubjects view)</li> <li>Instructors (via ems_vwInstructors view)</li> <li>Course Types (via ems_vwCourseTypes view)</li> <li>Terms (via ems_vwTerms view)</li> <li>Courses and Course Dates (via ems_vwCourses and ems_vwCourseDates views)</li></ul> <p><strong>Note:</strong>&#160; An extra view – ems_vwCourseDates_IDs is provided for customers using Banner and PeopleSoft for their SIS.</p> <p>When publishing your course schedule in EMS or when changing room assignments in EMS post-publish, the EMS Campus Web Service updates course room information in your SIS.&#160; This is the only information that the EMS Campus Web Service updates in the SIS database.</p> <p><img alt="" class="internal" style="width: 939px;height: 638px;" width="939px" height="638px" src="Images/CampusWeb_WebServiceOverview.png" /></p> <h2><a name="_Toc385925074"></a>EMS/SIS Synchronization</h2> <p>Synchronization functions are executed by the Domain Scheduler using the EMS Campus client application.&#160; After changes are made in the SIS, the EMS Campus Web Service pulls that information into EMS Campus when a sync is ran from the Manage Terms screen.</p> <p>When the Domain Scheduler publishes a term in EMS, reservations and bookings are created in EMS and updates to course room assignments are pushed back to the SIS.&#160; Post-publish changes to course room assignments made in EMS are automatically updated in the SIS.</p> <h2><a name="_Toc385925075"></a>Other Synchronization Options</h2> <p>If creating database views in your SIS is not possible, alternatives are possible:</p> <ul> <li>If an SIS is not available or is incompatible with the EMS Campus, course-related data from files exported from your SIS in a tab-delimited format can be used.&#160; This is a one-way import; EMS Campus will not update course room assignments back into your SIS. See <a title="Appendix A - Format for Tab-Delimited Files">this section</a> for file format information.</li></ul> <![CDATA[ ]]></body>
