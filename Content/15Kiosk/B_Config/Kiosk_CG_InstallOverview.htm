        <p>This section provides guidance in administering EMS Kiosk for System Administration and IT users.&#160;Run on a touch-screen display unit, EMS Kiosk is a powerful yet easy-to-use digital room sign and interactive tool for reviewing room availability, booking space, searching for a meeting location and more. Mount the unit outside a room and/or make an EMS Kiosk available in a lobby or entryway. Pair with the optional Floor Plan module and give users an added measure of convenience as they see reserved/available space on a facility diagram, making it even easier to find a meeting or a place to hold one.&#160;Everyday users interact with kiosks to view today’s events, make a reservation, view their existing reservations, locate a person who has reservations for today, and, if enabled, check into and out of a building.&#160;</p>
        <p>You must be licensed for this optional component.&#160;If you are unsure if your organization is licensed for the EMS Kiosk, or if you would like to learn more about it, please contact your Account Executive.</p>
