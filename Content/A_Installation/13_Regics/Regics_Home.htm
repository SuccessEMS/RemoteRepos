        <h1>Regics Installation Guide</h1>
        <p>EMS Regics is an online event registration software tool that provides event planners and organizers with data management and control of their events and attendees. The application also provides for the quick and easy creation of professional online surveys that can be standalone surveys, or that can be used in support of events. </p>
        <p>The <a href="file:///C:/Users/Jen.Naused/OneDrive - EMS Software/Technical Documentation/PDFs/Regics/EMS_Regics_InstallationGuide.pdf" style="font-style: italic;">EMS&#160;Regics Installation Guide PDF</a>&#160;lists the steps you must take to install or upgrade EMS Regics.</p>
        <h2>Credit Card Payments</h2>
        <p>EMS Regics can integrate with various third-party hosted payment page providers to provide a secure, seamless and low-cost option for organizations wanting to add credit card payment options to their registration process without having to worry about credit card security and Payment Card Industry (PCI) rules.  Because credit card data isn’t actually captured, transmitted or stored by our application, EMS Regics is not classified as a payment application under PCI rules and exempt from PCI compliance standards.  Third party hosted payment page solutions, however, are categorized as payment applications and service providers marketing this capability are held to the PCI standards.  These providers are required to host their solutions within PCI compliant data centers and their applications must be PA-DSS certified.</p>
