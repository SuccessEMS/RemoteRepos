        <h1>Working With Event Locations</h1>
        <p class="Body">The <em>event location</em> is the location where the event is to take place. For example, if you are managing a calendar for a university’s athletic events, you could set up a list of possible locations for the event, such as the stadium, the field house, the sports arena, the gymnasium, and so on. When you set up a location in Master Calendar, you can also provide a hyperlink for the location. For example, if you are managing a university’s athletic calendar, and you add the football stadium as a location, you can include a URL for&#160;a webpage showing a map of the stadium. The Location field for an event can be optional or required, depending upon your Master Calendar parameter settings. This topic guides you in setting up new&#160;event locations, <span class="Link"><span style="text-decoration: none;">activating</span></span> and <span class="Link"><span style="text-decoration: none;">de-activating</span></span> event locations, <span class="Link"><span style="text-decoration: none;">editing</span></span> event locations, and <span class="Link"><span style="text-decoration: none;">deleting</span></span> event locations.</p> <p class="Body"><strong>See Also:</strong>&#160;<span class="Link"><a title="Default Page Configuration Settings">Default Page Configuration Settings</a></span></p> <h2>Setting Up a New Event Location</h2> <p class="StepNumberBegin">1.
