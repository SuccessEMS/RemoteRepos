        <p>Run on a touch-screen display unit, EMS Kiosk App is a powerful yet easy-to-use digital room sign and interactive tool for reviewing room availability, booking space, searching for a meeting location and more. Kiosks are typically mounted&#160;outside a room and/or&#160;in a lobby or entryway. Everyday users interact with kiosks to view today’s events, make a reservation, view their existing reservations, locate a person who has reservations for today, and, if enabled, view floor plans and check into and out of a building.&#160;</p>
