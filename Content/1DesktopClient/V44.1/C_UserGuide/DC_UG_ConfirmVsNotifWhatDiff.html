        <h2>Confirmations&#160;</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>These are either sent out automatically after a booking is made in EMS Web App, or manually from the EMS desktop client.</li>
            <li>They contain the date/time/resources for the booking that was created.</li>
            <li>These usually go to end users so they know when their event is and if they owe any money.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Notifications&#160;</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>These are sent out automatically based on the filters on the notification rule:</li>
            <li>There are five types of notification rules:<br /><img src="../../../Resources/Images/DTC_V44.1_Confirm/Confirmations.png" alt="https://success.emssoftware.com/@api/deki/files/4172/DTCnotificationtypes.png?revision=1" /></li>
            <li>These are mostly sent out X days before a booking.&#160; They are triggered when a change occurs on a booking, service order, and so forth&#160;within that range of days.</li>
        </ul>
