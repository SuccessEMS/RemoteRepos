        <h1>Reservations, Bookings, and Booking Details</h1>
        <p>The two essential EMS components for meeting and event scheduling are reservations and bookings. To use the EMS Web Client efficiently and effectively, you must understand the structure of a reservation in EMS, the concept of an event timeline for a reservation booking, and how to make a reservation. This section covers the following topics:</p>

        </ul>
        <h2><a name="ReservationStructure"></a>Reservation Structure</h2>
        <p>An event in EMS Desktop Client is comprised of the following:</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li>A&#160;Reservation</li>
            <li>One or more&#160;Bookings</li>
            <li>Booking details</li>
        </ol>
        <p>These three components exist in a hierarchy—a reservation contains one or more bookings and each booking can have one or more details associated with it.</p>
        <h3>Reservations</h3>
        <p>A reservation is the who and the what of an event. For example, Group X (the who) can reserve some space for an Event Y (the what). A booking is the where and the when of an event. For example, Group X can schedule the conference room (the where) for a staff meeting on the second Monday in January (the when). Group X now has a single reservation with a single booking in EMS. If, however, Group X schedules the conference room (the where) for a staff meeting on the second Monday of each month for a calendar year (the when), then Group X now has a single reservation with twelve bookings in EMS.</p>
        <h3>Booking Details</h3>
        <p>A booking can have one or more booking details associated with it. Booking details are the resources or services that are needed for an event, the notes for the event, the activities for the event, the room charges for the event, or any combination of these. For example, for Group X’s staff meeting, the resources could include the requested catering (coffee service, bagels and muffins, and so on) and the A/V equipment (a projector, a speaker’s podium, and so on).</p>
        <h2><a name="EventTimeline"></a>Event Timeline</h2>
        <p>The following time designators are used for an event in EMS Desktop Client:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Event Time:&#160;The time period during which the event actually takes place.</li>
            <li>Setup/Teardown Hours: The hours, or fractions of hours, that you add to the event time to allow staff to prepare a room for the event or to clean up after the event.</li>
            <li>Reserved Time: The total time for which the space (the where) is reserved. This time is the event time plus the setup/teardown time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Making a Reservation Using the Reservation Wizard</h2>
        <p>The Reservation Wizard allows you to check for available space and make a reservation for an event. You can search for rooms that are available for a particular time on one day (a simple reservation with one booking) or on multiple days (a series reservation with multiple bookings). You can also create a series reservation by selecting one date and time, but multiple rooms. To make a reservation using the wizard, you must:</p>

        <h4>III. To search for a specific room:</h4>
        <p>You can use the&#160;Specific Room&#160;search to book a standard EMS room or a room or area that is not managed in EMS. An override room, or “override description,” is used to book an event in a space that has not been configured in your EMS system. For example, your EMS administrator might have configured an override room named “Other Area” in the Engineering building. To book an event in Dr. Wilson's office, which is a room that is not defined in EMS, in the Engineering building, you can select the “Other Area” room and specify “Dr. Wilson's Office” for the location. EMS does not track availability for events booked in override rooms; however, EMS reports on events that are scheduled in an override room just like any other event scheduled for any other room.</p>

        <h2>Viewing and Editing Reservations in the Reservation Book</h2>
        <p>The Reservation Book provides a graphical view of all the confirmed reservations (the reserved time as well as the room for which the reservation is scheduled) for your organization. (Canceled bookings are not shown.) You use the Reservation Book to the view information for a reservation, to edit an existing reservation, and to make a new reservation. In addition, when the Reservation Book first opens, before you edit or make a reservation, you can change the Reservation Book view so that it better suits your working needs.</p>

                        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;margin-left: 36pt;">
                            <li style="list-style-type: disc;">Clear Always Prompt for Room Filter on Startup.</li>

                        <p>Note: The building, area, or view that you select is not important. This last step just clears the “all” building option from the Reservation Book cache and ensures that the Filter dialog box does not open on top of the Reservation Book. Going forward, you can always select all buildings, or any specific building, area, or view as needed when you are working in the Reservation Book.</p>
