        <p>You use Manage Services to search for&#160;and view the resources with and without service orders for all bookings on a particular day as well as the current state of the resources and their Reviewed status. After viewing a resource, if applicable, you can change the state for a resource. You can review a resource, or you can mark a resource as un-reviewed. You can also open a resource in the Navigator, and edit it if necessary.</p>
        <p>Concept:&#160;What is a Service Order, Category, and Resource? (click to expand)</p>
        <p>In EMS, you may hear these terms used&#160;interchangeably sometimes, however, they are different concepts.</p>
        <p>A&#160;Category&#160;in EMS is anything you might add to a Booking such as Catering, Audio Visual, Furniture, Security, Notes, Attendee Names, Agendas etc.&#160;When you configure a Category, however, it must be of six&#160;Category&#160;types:&#160;Activities, Attendees, Catering, Notes, Resources with Service Orders, or Resources Without Service Orders. These types cause the service to&#160;behave slightly differently when&#160;added to a booking. For example, a Notes/Activities/Attendees&#160;type service category&#160;does not require the EMS Administrator to configure items&#160;under it and there is nothing for a person to “select” from these types of services.</p>
        <p>By contrast, a&#160;service category that has a type of&#160;Catering,&#160;Resource with Service Order, or a Resource without a&#160;Service Order Category,&#160;will require the Administrator to create items&#160;under it. For example, an&#160;"AV Equipment" service category (configured as a Resource without a Service Order Category type) might have items under it such as a flip chart, whiteboard, (under AV Equipment).&#160;The person requesting the service for this meeting would then select&#160;AV equipment; then&#160;flipchart&#160;and&#160;whiteboard&#160;would be typical options to add to the event.&#160;</p>
        <p>Tip:&#160;The following Category Types allow&#160;<a href="https://success.emssoftware.com/?title=Installation_%26_Setup_Guides/EMS_Client_V44.1/Setting_Up_EMS_Desktop_Client/060_Core_Configuration_-_Resources/070_Defining_Production_Areas_and_Production_Items_for_a_Resource" title="Defining Production Areas and Production Items for a Catering Resource">Production Items</a>: Catering, Resources with Service Orders, and Resources Without Service Orders.&#160;</p>
        <p>Furthermore, a Category can&#160;<a href="https://success.emssoftware.com/?title=Installation_%26_Setup_Guides/EMS_Client_V44.1/Setting_Up_EMS_Desktop_Client/050_Core_Configuration_-_Administration/010_Configuring_Categories" title="https://success.emssoftware.com/EMS_V44.1/Installing_and_Setting_Up_EMS/EMS_Desktop_Client/Setting_Up_EMS_Desktop_Client/050_Core_Configuration_-_Administration/010_Configuring_Categories">be configured&#160;to "Use States"&#160;</a>so that when a service is requested with a meeting, it can be managed through a review and approval process in the Manage Services toolbar option&#160;&#160;in EMS Desktop Client.&#160;<br /><img src="../../../Resources/Images/DTC_V44.1_ManServOr/Managing Service Orders.png" alt="https://success.emssoftware.com/@api/deki/files/5970/clipboard_e9d0b1d823c09fb0734a820c64ddd5789.png?revision=1&amp;size=bestfit&amp;width=61&amp;height=33" /></p>

If a service order is part of a category that has been configured to "Use States," but none has been assigned, then (none) is displayed in the State column for the booking. If your Administrator has not configured categories in your system to use states, then the State column will be blank.</li>
            <li>If a resource has been reviewed for a booking, “Yes” shows in the Reviewed column for the booking.</li>
            <li>If your Options are set to show deleted service orders/items, an “x” appears next to the booking for which the orders/items were deleted and a single line through the booking is displayed.</li>
