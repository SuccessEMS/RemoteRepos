        <h1 class="Heading1">Configure Calculations</h1>
        <p>Calculations&#160;are additional charges that can be applied to billable items (a category, a group, a group type, a resource, or a room) such as gratuity or sales tax. Both pricing methods and calculations determine the final cost for a billable item; however, unlike pricing, which is applied when a billable item is reserved (and retained, even if the price for the item later changes), calculations are figured each time a confirmation or an invoice is generated. When you&#160;<a href="https://success.emssoftware.com/Older_Releases_(V44%2C_V43)/EMS_Version_44/Installing_and_Setting_Up_EMS/EMS_Desktop_Client/Setting_Up_EMS_Desktop_Client/070_Core_Configuration_-_Billing/040_Configuring_Calculations#RTF436f6e6669677572655f6361">configure</a>&#160;a calculation, you must specify the rate for the calculation, the calculation sequence (the order in which the calculation is carried out relative to other calculations), and if applicable, the minimum charge for the calculation. You must also indicate whether the calculation should be carried out on the base amount or on a running total, and whether the result of the calculation should be added to the base amount and then considered in subsequent calculations. For example, consider the following four calculations for a base amount of $1,000.00:</p>
