        <h1>Invite People</h1>
        <p>When inviting people to your meetings, it is important to understand the difference between Attendees and Groups.&#160;<strong>Attendees </strong>are individuals who are invited to meetings. A&#160;<strong>Group </strong>is the person(s) responsible for the meeting.&#160;Your Administrator sets the label for the Group&#160;field, so the name may vary&#160;(in the example below, it is labeled "Customer").&#160; A Group can designate a <strong>First Contact</strong> to oversee questions, changes, and updates to the meeting (First Contacts are optional).&#160;<strong>First Contacts</strong>&#160;will receive notifications regarding any meeting changes.</p>
        <p>Concept:&#160;<strong>Attendees </strong>= Invitees; <strong>Group </strong>or <strong>First Contact</strong> = Meeting Organizers</p>
