        <h1 class="mt-export-title">Booking a Video Conference</h1>
        <p class="Body">Booking a video conference is basically the same as <a target="_blank" title="https://success.emssoftware.com/EMS_V44.1/Using_EMS/Using_EMS_Desktop_Client/080_Reservations_and_Bookings/Making_a_Reservation_Using_the_Reservation_Wizard">making a standard reservation</a>, except for a few differences:</p>

<ol>
    <li class="Body">On the first screen of the Reservation Wizard, choose a video conference template option from the&#160;<strong>Wizard Template</strong>&#160;dropdown, as shown in the example below. Your Administrator configures these templates; if none are available, contact your Administrator. Additionally, set the&#160;<strong>Search</strong>&#160;method to "Standard."<br />
    <img alt="" class="internal default" /></li>
    <li class="Body">You select at least two rooms for video conferences; one is the "host" where the presenter drives the video conference, and the other room(s) are "endpoints" where attendees participate in the video conference. You can have multiple rooms and one host. On the second screen of the wizard where you select rooms for the booking, select all rooms involved including your host room.<br />
    <img alt="" class="internal default" /></li>
    <li class="Body">&#160;An additional "Video Conference" tab is available for video conferencing on the third screen of the wizard where you designate one of the rooms as the host.&#160;</li>
    <li class="Body">Once you finalize your reservation the host room shows in the Navigator with "Yes" under the&#160;<strong>VC Host</strong>&#160;column. Each room shows as a booking under the reservation, and if your Administrator has configured it, resources needed for a video conference, such as a Video Conference cart, are automatically included as details under the bookings.<br />
