        <h1>Manage Custom Field Hints</h1>
        <p>A <em>cus</em><em>tom field</em> is found on the Submit Event page in EMS Master Calendar.&#160;Custom fields supply additional information about events on the calendar for guests or users. &#160;As a Master Calendar manager, you can provide&#160;<em>hints</em> or suggestions about these fields&#160;to the user. For example, if you are managing calendars for a university campus, and one of these calendars is for athletic events, you might add a custom field that indicates where ticket pricing information is available for the event. This topic guides you in creating, activating/de-acitvating, editing, and deleting these custom field hints.</p>
        <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tip"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img alt="" class="internal default" /></td> <td> <p><strong>Concept:</strong>When you add a custom field hint, you are adding to a global list, which means that any hint that you add can be made available for any event submission form.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
        <p>1. On the Admin menu, point to <strong>Configuration </strong>&gt; <strong>Custom Field Hints</strong>.&#160;The Custom Field Hints page opens on the Active tab, listing all currently active custom field hints in Master Calendar.</p>
