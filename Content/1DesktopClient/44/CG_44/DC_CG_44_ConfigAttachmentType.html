        <p>The term&#160;attachment&#160;is used to describe any file that you can add to or store&#160;on a reservation or booking. (Unlike a drawing, which is simply referenced, an attachment is actually stored in the EMS database with the reservation or booking record.) Attachments can be used for a variety of purposes, such as providing information about your company’s alcohol policies, any special food concerns for the event’s attendees, and so on. You can&#160;configure&#160;and store a variety of attachment types and then your users can select whichever type is most appropriate when working with attachments for a reservation or booking.</p>
        <p>An attachment can also be a file that is saved with the room record or a group record. You do not specify an attachment type for a room record. For information about adding an attachment to a room record, see&#160;<span class="Hyperlink">To add attachments to a room</span>.&#160;For information about adding an attachment to a group, see the EMS User’s Manual.</p>
