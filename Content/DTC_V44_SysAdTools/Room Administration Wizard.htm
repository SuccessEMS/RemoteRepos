        <p>Tip:&#160;The search string is not case-sensitive, but your search is limited to the exact order of the characters in the string and it must begin with the information for which you are searching.

            <li>Do one of the following:</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>To keep all public views as is (none of the selected rooms are to be added to any existing public views), leave Keep Existing Settings selected, and then click Next.</li>
            <li>To add the selected rooms to one or more of the existing public views, click Add to Existing Settings, and on the Available list, select the view or CTRL-click to select the multiple views, click the Move (&gt;) button to move the selected views to the Selected list, and then click Next.</li>

        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>For Users, User Templates, and Web Process Templates, a third option, Overwrite Existing Settings is available. If you select this option, then the current (existing) room access for the configuration item is replaced by the room access that you define here.

        <p>Tip:&#160;EMS Enterprise has both the View and Book and the View Only access for user security. EMS Professional has just the View and Book access for user security.</p>

            <li><b>View and Book</b>—A user who has access to the Special - Edit Critical Booking Information process&#160;and&#160;who is assigned to this option can reserve the room, move an event into or out of the room, change the time or status of an event that is scheduled in the room, and add resources to events in the room.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tip:&#160;The Special - View and Book Access On All Rooms process can be used as an alternative to manually assigning all rooms to the View and Book list. See&#160;“Configuring User Security for Multiple User Accounts”.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="button">View Only</span>—A user who is assigned to this option cannot reserve the room, move an event into or out of the room, or change the time or status of an event that is scheduled in the room; however, as long as the user has access to the appropriate category and to the Special - Edit Booking Details process, the user can view events in the room and add resources to events in the room.</li>
            <li>For Web Process Templates, select the appropriate access, and then go to&#160;Step 8.</li>
            <li>Move rooms that can be reserved without approval (that is, booked into the Reserve Status on the Web Template tab) into the Reserve pane.</li>
