        <h1>EMS Kiosk </h1>
        <p>This section provides guidance in administering EMS Kiosk for System Administration and IT users. Run on a touch-screen display unit, EMS Kiosk is a powerful yet easy-to-use digital room sign and interactive tool for reviewing room availability, booking space, searching for a meeting location and more. Mount the unit outside a room and/or make an EMS Kiosk available in a lobby or entryway. Pair with the optional Floor Plan module and give users an added measure of convenience as they see reserved/available space on a facility diagram, making it even easier to find a meeting or a place to hold one. Everyday users interact with kiosks to view today’s events, make a reservation, view their existing reservations, locate a person who has reservations for today, and, if enabled, check into and out of a building.</p>
        <p>You must be licensed for this optional component. If you are unsure if your organization is licensed for the EMS Kiosk, or if you would like to learn more about it, please contact your Account Executive.</p>
