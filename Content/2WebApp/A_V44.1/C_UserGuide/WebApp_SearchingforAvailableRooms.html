        <h1>Searching for Available Rooms</h1>
        <p>During the booking process, you can search for available rooms in two ways:&#160;</p>
        <ol>
            <li>From the Create a Reservation screen, in the Bookings area, select</li>
            <ul class="mt-indent-1">
                <li><strong>Let Me Search For A Room</strong>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>OR</p>
            <ul class="mt-indent-1">
                <li><strong>I Know What Room I Want&#160;</strong>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <img src="Images/C_UserGuide/WA_SearchingforAvailableRooms_RoomRequestPage.png" />
        </p>
        <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tip">
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/tech_doc_tip.png" />
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        <p><strong>Tips:</strong>&#160;Filters in the left panel&#160;help you narrow your Room Search Results.&#160;When you click&#160;Search, results appear on the right. From these results, you can view expanded Room Details&#160;by clicking on the room name, and you can view&#160;any available floor plans&#160;by clicking the floor plan icon next to it.</p>
                        <p>You can click the&#160;<strong>Add/Remove</strong>&#160;buttons next to Locations, Floors, Setup Types, and Features to add or expand your filters. To set Favorite Rooms to use every time, <strong>See Also:</strong>&#160;<a title="Favoriting Rooms">Favoriting Rooms</a>.&#160;</p>
                        <p>Locating space as part of the reservation process is different than browsing locations.&#160;For detailed instructions on using the BROWSE LOCATIONS option&#160;in the main menu to see available and booked space, <strong>See Also:</strong>&#160;Browsing Locations.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li><em>To filter your search by Location</em>, click&#160;<strong>Add/Remove</strong>&#160;next to Location. This presents a list of locations by Building or view. Select the locations filters you wish to apply (or search by keyword), and then click&#160;<strong>Update Locations</strong>. This filters the results of your keyword search on the Add New Favorite Room dialog (above).&#160;Your filter settings are&#160;saved and you will have to go back in and remove&#160;them if you wish to expand search results beyond these locations.<br /></li>

            <li>Once you have located a room to reserve, click the&#160;Add&#160;Plus&#160;icon to add it to your reservation; this adds the booking to your cart. You can change your mind and delete or change the room for the booking before you finalize your Reservation.</li>
