        <h1>Work with Event Locations</h1>
        <p>The <em>event location</em> is the location where the event is to take place. For example, if you are managing a calendar for a university’s athletic events, you could set up a list of possible locations for the event, such as the stadium, the field house, the sports arena, the gymnasium, and so on. When you set up a location in Master Calendar, you can also provide a hyperlink for the location. For example, if you are managing a university’s athletic calendar, and you add the football stadium as a location, you can include a URL for&#160;a webpage showing a map of the stadium. The Location field for an event can be optional or required, depending upon your Master Calendar parameter settings. This topic guides you in setting up new&#160;event locations, activating and de-activating event locations, editing event locations, and deleting event locations.</p>

        <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tip"> <tbody> <tr> <td><img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/tech_doc_tip.png" alt="" class="internal default" /></td> <td> <p><strong>Tips:</strong>You can delete a Location only if no sub-locations reference the location. If any sub-locations reference the selected location, you must first delete the&#160;sub-locations, and then you can delete the location.&#160;We recommend reviewing and editing&#160;your sub-locations first. <strong>See Also</strong>:&#160;<a title="Managing Event Sub-Locations">Working With&#160;Event Sub-Locations</a>.&#160;</p> <p>If you delete an active event location, any current events that use this location are not affected. The deletion simply means that going forward, the location is not available for use.&#160;You can delete only one location at a time.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
        <ul>
            <li>Click the Delete icon  next to the Location you wish to delete. &#160;If any sub-locations reference the selected location, a dialog box launches indicating the number of sub-locations that reference it. You must first delete these sub-locations before you can delete the location.&#160;If no sub-locations reference the selected location, a message prompts you to confirm that you want to delete the selected location.</li>
            <li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.&#160;A message opens confirming the deletion.&#160;</li>
            <li>Click OK in the message.&#160;The list of locations is updated to reflect the deletion of the event location.</li>
