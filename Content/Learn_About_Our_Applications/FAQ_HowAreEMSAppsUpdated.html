        <h2>EMS Structure</h2>
        <p>EMS consists of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Database</strong>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Web Server</strong>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Applications&#160;</strong>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Optional Features and&#160;</strong><strong>Services</strong>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each has its own installation and upgrade procedure. You can download the EMS License Key, Server Install, and updates for all components at the <a href="http://www.dea.com/ServiceAndSupport/productdownloads.aspx" title="http://www.dea.com/ServiceAndSupport/productdownloads.aspx">Downloads Portal </a>(once you are logged in). You will only see downloads for products you are licensed on. Updates for {{product_dtc}} are delivered in patches and builds. All other components are updated with builds and/or DLLs.</p>
        <h2>EMS Maintenance</h2>
        <p>EMS follows an agile development model: we release frequent software updates&#160;via monthly maintenance releases.If you have active maintenance, your technical contact will be notified via email of these&#160;releases.&#160;Please review your assigned technical contacts; to make changes, please&#160;<a class="F1" rel="internal" title="EMS_V44/Installing_and_Setting_Up_EMS/EMS_Desktop_Client/Installing_EMS_Desktop_Client/02-Customer_Support" href="../../absolute/Template_EMSTemplates/Contacting_EMS_Support/page.html" alt="EMS_V44/Installing_and_Setting_Up_EMS/EMS_Desktop_Client/Installing_EMS_Desktop_Client/02-Customer_Support">contact Customer Support</a>.</p>

                        <p><em>Minor, cumulative&#160;updates to a version</em>, such as V44.1 <em>Update 10</em>. An update may not affect all components, so for example, Update 1 affected the EMS Database, the Desktop Client, Exchange, and EMS for Outlook, but&#160;Update 2 only affected the Desktop Client and EMS for Outlook. Updates are cumulative, which means that&#160;to bring one of your affected components&#160;up to the most current version, you can skip any older updates that you missed and only install the latest update. For example, to update your EMS for Outlook from V44.1 all the way up to Update 2, you only need to install Update 2 for EMS for Outlook. That single install includes all updates from Update 1 and Update&#160;2.</p>
