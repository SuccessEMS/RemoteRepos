        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The EMS-RoomWizard Interface is an optional module for communicating room reservation information between EMS and Steelcase RoomWizard. A RoomWizard is a wall-mounted unit that is associated with a particular room and used to schedule and view events in it. Once a connection has been established between a specific unit and an EMS database, EMS booking information is automatically displayed on the RoomWizard device for that room.&#160; In addition, new impromptu meetings and adjustments to existing meetings made directly on a RoomWizard unit are automatically relayed to the EMS database.&#160; This document lists the steps you must take to install and configure the EMS-RoomWizard interface for older and newer generation RoomWizard devices.&#160;</p>
