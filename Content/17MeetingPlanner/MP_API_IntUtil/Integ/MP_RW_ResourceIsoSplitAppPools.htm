        <h1>Resource Isolation: Splitting Application Pools</h1>
        <h2>Background&#160;</h2>
        <p>The RoomWizard Connector is setup as a web application, side-by-side with the MeetingPlanner and MeetingPlanner_WS applications. &#160;All of these applications, by default, share an application pool. &#160;If issues are encountered or a better allocation of resources on the application server is required or desired, the RoomWizard Connector can be split into its own application pool. &#160;This will allow the MeetingPlanner users and RoomWizard Connector to maintain separate connection pools and memory allocations.</p>
        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <ol start="1">
            <li>Open IIS.</li>
            <li>Create a new application pool. &#160;this new application pool will be the RoomWizard App Pool and should mirror the MeetingPlanner App Pool setup (see below).&#160;</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Image_001.png</p>
        <p>Image_002.png</p>
        <ol start="3">
            <li>Once the RoomWizard App Pool is created, select the Default Web Site &gt; RoomWizard application. &#160;</li>
            <li>Click "Advanced Settings" and update the Application Pool from MeetingPlannerAppPool to the RoomWizard pool that was just created.</li>
            <li>After completion, it may also be beneficial to reset IIS.</li>
        </ol>
