        <p>This element is only used to link an event with a Department that either hosts or services a meeting (so they can send notifications &amp; confirmations, track billing, and initiate&#160;invoices), so you do not need to define departments in EMS other than these. Typically, these are departments that absorb the cost of hosting events, and departments like A/V or Catering that provide services.&#160;All financial transactions in EMS are batched by department. Groups and customers make payments to one or more departments for the events they schedule at your organization’s facilities</p>
        <p>As the EMS administrator, you configure&#160;departments for your organization&#160;so they can notify attendees and send invoices linked to billing and PO numbers.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;margin-left: 36pt;" start="1">
            <li>On the EMS menu bar, click Configuration &gt; Administration &gt;&#160;Departments.&#160;The Departments window opens. The window displays all departments that are currently configured in your EMS database and that have a status of Active. To view all departments in your EMS database, regardless of status, under Show, click Inactive.</li>
