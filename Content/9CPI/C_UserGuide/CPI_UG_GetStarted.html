                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/tech_doc_tip.png" alt="" class="internal default" />

                    <td>
                        <p><strong>Tips: </strong>If the list of available terms is extensive, you can enter a search string in one or more of the available search fields and search for a specific term. Your search is not case-sensitive, but the search is limited to the exact order of the characters in the string and it must begin with the information for which you are searching. For example, to search for 2008 Spring, you can enter 2008, but not Spring. After you tab out of a search field, the list of available terms that meet all your search criteria is dynamically updated.</p>
