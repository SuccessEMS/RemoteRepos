        <p>Typically, a subject is associated with a single academic unit; however, there may be times when you must assign a subject to multiple academic units, or departments. For example, you may need to assign a History class to a department in the College of Arts and Sciences and to a department in the College of Liberal Arts. In this case, you must <a>configure</a> a <em>primary</em> academic unit for the subject. A primary academic unit for a subject ensures the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When {{product}} assigns a building preference to a course that belongs to a shared subject, it uses the building preference for the primary academic unit.</li>
            <li>When {{product}} publishes a course that belongs to a shared subject, it uses the Group, Event Type, and Reservation Source for the primary academic unit.</li>
            <li>When a course that belongs to a shared subject is displayed in the Navigator or Course Navigator, the primary academic unit for the course is displayed on the Course Info tab.</li>
        </ul>
