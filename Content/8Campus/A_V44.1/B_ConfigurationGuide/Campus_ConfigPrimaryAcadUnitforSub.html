        <p>Typically, a subject is associated with a single academic unit; however, there may be times when you must assign a subject to multiple academic units, or departments. For example, you may need to assign a History class to a department in the College of Arts and Sciences and to a department in the College of Liberal Arts. In this case, you must <a>configure</a> a <em>primary</em> academic unit for the subject. A primary academic unit for a subject ensures the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>When {{product}} assigns a building preference to a course that belongs to a shared subject, it uses the building preference for the primary academic unit.</li>
            <li>When {{product}} publishes a course that belongs to a shared subject, it uses the Group, Event Type, and Reservation Source for the primary academic unit.</li>
            <li>When a course that belongs to a shared subject is displayed in the Navigator or Course Navigator, the primary academic unit for the course is displayed on the Course Info tab.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>1. On the {{product_campus}} menu bar, click Academic Planning &gt; Configuration &gt; <strong>Subjects</strong>.&#160;The Subjects window opens, listing all the subjects currently configured in your {{product}} database for the indicated domain.</p>
        <div class="pformat style-wrap" title="Figure_Title">
            <p>
                <img border="0" class="internal" />
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>2. On the Domain dropdown list, select the domain for which you are configuring the subject, select the appropriate subject, and then click <strong>Edit</strong>.&#160;The Subject dialog box opens. This dialog box lists the code and description for the selected subject and the code for the selected domain.</p>
        <table border="0" cellspacing="0" class="tip"> <tbody> <tr> <td> <div> <p><img class="internal" /></p></div></td> <td> <p>This information was imported from your SIS and you cannot edit it.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
        <p>
            <img border="0" class="internal" />
        </p>
        <p>3. Select the primary academic unit for the subject. (The default value is None.)</p>
        <p>4. Click <strong>OK</strong>.&#160;The Subject dialog box closes. You return to the Subjects window with the newly configured subject automatically selected.</p>
