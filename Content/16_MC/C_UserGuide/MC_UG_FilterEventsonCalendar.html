        <p>Note: “Rooms” is the default label for a sub-location. Depending on how your Master&#160;Calendar site administrator has configured Master Calendar, you may see this&#160;labeled differently, such as “Fields,” “Offices,” and so on.&#160;</p>
        <p>“Department” is a default label. Depending on how your Master Calendar site&#160;administrator has configured Master Calendar, you may see this labeled as&#160;something different, such as “Business Units.”</p>
