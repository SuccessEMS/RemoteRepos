        <p>Concept:&#160;You Can Assign Rate Schedules to Specific Rooms and Resources.</p>
        <p>After you define your organization’s rate schedules, you have three options for&#160;manually&#160;assigning the prices to billable items (rooms and resources) based on these schedules:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 72pt;">
            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">During the configuration of a room or resource. When you are configuring a room or resource, the configuration dialog box contains a Pricing tab. This tab lists all the rate schedules that are currently configured in your EMS database. You can specify the pricing method for the billable item that you are configuring for each rate schedule. You can also specify a discount percentage for the item, a minimum charge for the item, a maximum charge for the item, or any combination of these options.

            <li style="list-style-type: circle;">After all necessary rooms and resources are configured. Both the Rooms window and the Resources window contain a Pricing button. You can click Pricing to open an Edit Pricing window. You can use the options on this window to specify the pricing method for the billable items (rooms and resources) for a selected rate schedule. You can also specify a discount percentage for the item, a minimum charge for the item, a maximum charge for the item, or any combination of these options.

After you have defined a rate schedule, you can select a rate schedule in the Rate Schedules window and click Pricing to open an Edit Pricing window.
