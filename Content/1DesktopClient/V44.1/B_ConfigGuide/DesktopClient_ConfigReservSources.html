        <p>A <span class="button">reservation source</span> indicates the origination of a reservation request, for example, walk-up, email, <MadCap:variable name="General.EMS&#160;Web App" />, and so on. You can specify a reservation source at the time that the reservation is being made in the Reservation Wizard, or at a later date. You can also specify the reservation source as part of the search criteria when searching for a reservation in the Browser. Configuring a reservation source simply consists of naming or describing the source.</p>

        </ol>
        <p>Tip:&#160;The reservation source can be a maximum of 50 characters, including spaces.</p>
        <ol start="3" MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>Leave Inactive blank to add the reservation source as an active source. Optionally, select Inactive to inactivate the source. </li>
