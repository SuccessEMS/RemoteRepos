        <p>A Series Reservation is a single reservation that includes multiple bookings. EMS for Outlook allows you to search for rooms that are available at a particular time on multiple days to create a series reservation. This section details the creation of a series reservation for a non-video conference meeting. For information about scheduling a video conference meeting, see&#160;<a href="https://success.emssoftware.com/001_Using_EMS__(V44.1)/Using_EMS_for_Microsoft%C2%AE_Outlook/Using_EMS_for_Microsoft%C2%AE_Outlook/Creating_a_Video_Conference_Reservation" title="Creating a Video Conference Reservation"><span class="Hyperlink_2">Creating</span></a><a href="https://success.emssoftware.com/001_Using_EMS__(V44.1)/Using_EMS_for_Microsoft%C2%AE_Outlook/Using_EMS_for_Microsoft%C2%AE_Outlook/Creating_a_Video_Conference_Reservation" title="Creating a Video Conference Reservation"><span class="Hyperlink_2">&#160;a Video Conference Reservation</span></a><span class="link_2">.&#160;</span></p>
